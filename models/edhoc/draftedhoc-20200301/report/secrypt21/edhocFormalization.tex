The \mEdhoc{} \mSpec{} \cite{our-analysis-selander-lake-edhoc-00} claims
that \mEdhoc{} satisfies many security properties, but these are imprecisely
expressed and motivated.
%
In particular, there is no coherent adversary model.
%
It is therefore not clear in which context properties should be verified.
%
We resolve this by clearly specifying an adversary model, in which we can verify
properties.
%Therefore, we explore in which adversary models we can prove properties and
%incorporate those models into the properties themselves.
%

%In this section, we describe our approach and modeling choices towards
%formalizing the \mEdhoc{} protocol and the properties we verify.
%

\subsection{Adversary Model}\label{sec:threat-model}
We verify \mEdhoc{} in the symbolic Dolev-Yao model, with idealized
cryptographic primitives, e.g, encrypted messages can only be
decrypted using the key, no hash collisions exist etc.
%
The adversary controls the
communication channel, and can interact with an unbounded number of sessions
of the protocol, dropping, injecting and modifying messages at their liking.
%

In addition to the basic Dolev-Yao model, we also consider two more adversary
capabilities, namely long-term key reveal and ephemeral key reveal.
%
Long-term key reveal models an adversary compromising a party $A$'s
long-term private key \mPriv{A} at time $t$, and we denote this event by
$\mRevLTK^t(A)$.
%
The event $\mRevEph^t(A, k)$ represents that the adversary learns
the ephemeral private key \mPrivE{A} used by party $A$ at time $t$ in a session
establishing key material $k$.
%
These two capabilities model the possibility for long-term keys to be stored in a
hardened storage, a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), whereas ephemeral keys
may be stored in a less secure part of a device.
%
This is more granular and realistic than assuming an adversary have equal
opportunity to access both types of keys.
%

We now define and formalize the security properties we are interested in, and
then describe how we encode them into \mTamarin{}-tool.
%
The adversary model becomes part of the security properties themselves.
%

\subsection{Formalization of Properties}
\label{sec:desired-properties}
%Our model is based on event traces and we define the
%properties in terms of relations between timestamped events.
%
We use the \mTamarin{} verification
tool~\cite{DBLP:conf/cav/MeierSCB13} to encode the model and verify properties.
%
This tool uses a fragment of temporal first order logic to reason about
events and knowledge of the parties and of the adversary.
%
For conciseness we use a slightly different syntax than
that used by \mTamarin{}, but which has a direct mapping to \mTamarin{}'s logic.
%

Event types are predicates over global states of system execution.
%
Let $E$ be an event type and let $t$ be a timestamp associated with a point in a
trace.
%
Then $E^{t}(p_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ denotes an event of type $E$ associated with
a sequence of parameters $(p_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ at time $t$ in that trace.
%
In general, more than one event may have the same timestamp and hence
timestamps form a quasi order, which we denote by $t_1 \lessdot t_2$ when $t_1$
is before $t_2$ in a trace.
%
We define $\doteq$ analogously.
%
However, two events of the same type cannot have the same timestamp, so
$t_1 \doteq t_2$ implies $E^{t_1} = E^{t_2}$.
%
Two events having the same timestamp does not imply the there is a fork in the
trace, only that the two events happen simultaneously and that comparing their
timestamps results in that they are equal.
%
This notation corresponds to \mTamarin{}'s use of action facts
$E(p_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}@t$.
%

%Other first order logic connectives and parenthesis have their standard
%interpretation.
%
%A special event type $\mK$ represents adversary knowledge.
%
The event $\mK^t(p)$ denotes that the adversary knows a parameter $p$ at
time $t$.
%
Intuitively, $\mK^t(p)$ evaluates to true when $p$ is in
the closure of the
parameters the adversary observed from interacting with parties using the
protocol, under the Dolev-Yao message deduction operations and
the advanced adversary capabilities up until time $t$.
%
For a more precise definition of knowledge management, we refer to~\cite{DBLP:conf/cav/MeierSCB13}.
%

An example of a formula is
\[
    \forall t, k, k'\mLogicDot \mK^{t}(k) \land \mK^{t}(k')\ \rightarrow\ 
\mK^{t}(k),
\]
expressing that if there is a time $t$ when the adversary knows both $k$ and
$k'$, then it is true that the adversary knows only $k$ at the same point in
time.

An initiator $I$ considers the
protocol run started when it sends a message \mMsgone{} (event type \mIStart)
and the run completed after sending a message \mMsgthree{} (event type
\mIComplete).
%
Similarly, a responder $R$ considers the run started upon receiving
a \mMsgone{} (event type \mRStart), and completed upon receiving a \mMsgthree{}
(event type \mRComplete).
%
%As is customary, the properties we show are guaranteed to hold for a party when
%the party completes their part of the protocol run.

%
Informally, PFS captures the idea that session key material remains secret
even if a long-term key leaks in the future.

We define PFS for session key material \mSessKey{} as \mPredPfs{} in

% \knote{Note that our Tamarin model only reveals ephemeral keys first when a party
%     completes the run. So even if the formula above checks for ephemeral keys to

% }
The first parameter $I$ of the \mIComplete{} event represents the
initiator's identity,
and the second, $R$, represents that $I$ believes $R$ to be playing
the responder role.
%
The third parameter, \mSessKey{}, is the established session key material.
%
The parameters of the \mRComplete{} event are defined analogously.
%
Specifically, the first parameter of \mRComplete{} represents the identity of
whom $R$ believes is playing the initiator role.
%
%The meaning of remaining variables and types should be clear from previous
%descriptions.
%
The essence of the definition is that an adversary only knows \mSessKey{} if they
compromised one of the
parties long-term keys before that party completed the run, or if the adversary
compromised any of the ephemeral keys at any time after a party starts
its protocol run.
%
One way the definition slightly differs from the corresponding \mTamarin{} lemma
is that \mTamarin{} does not allow a disjunction on the left-hand side of an
implication in a universally quantified formula.
%
In the lemma, therefore, instead of the disjunction
$\mIComplete^{t_2}(I, R, \mSessKey)\, \lor\,  \mRComplete^{t_2}(I, R, \mSessKey)$,
we use a single action parametrized by $I$, $R$, and \mSessKey{} to signify that
\emph{either} party has completed their role.

\subsubsection{Authentication}
%\runhead{Authentication}
\label{sec:authenticationDef}
We prove two different flavors of authentication, the first being classical
\emph{injective agreement} following Lowe~\cite{DBLP:conf/csfw/Lowe97a}, and
the second being an implicit agreement property.
%
Informally, injective agreement guarantees to an initiator $I$ that whenever
$I$ completes a run ostensibly with a responder $R$,
then $R$ has been engaged in the protocol as a responder,
and this run of $I$ corresponds to a unique run of $R$.
%
In addition, the property guarantees to $I$ that the two parties agree on a set
$S$ of parameters associated with the run, including, in particular, the
session key material \mSessKey{}.
%
However, we will treat \mSessKey{} separately for clarity.
%
On completion, $I$ knows that $R$ has access to the session key material.
%
The corresponding property for $R$ is analogous.
%

Traditionally, the event types used to describe injective agreement are called
\emph{Running} and \emph{Commit}, but to harmonize the presentations of
authentication and PFS in this section, we refer to these event types as
\mIStart{} and \mIComplete{} respectively for the initiator, and
\mRStart{} and \mRComplete{} for the responder.
%
For the initiator role we define injective agreement by
\mPredInjI{} in Figure~\ref{fig:props}.

%
The property captures that for an initiator $I$, either the injective agreement
property as described above holds, or the long-term key of the believed
responder $R$ has been compromised before $I$ completed its role.
%
Note that this places no restrictions on the reveals of the ephemeral
keys, or the reveal of the initiator's long-term key.
%
For the responder we define the property \mPredInjR{} as in
Figure~\ref{fig:props}.

%------------------------------------------------------------- Implicit auth
Unlike PFS, not all \mEdhoc{} methods enjoy the injective agreement property.
%
Hence, we show for all methods a form of \emph{implicit agreement} on all the
parameters mentioned above.
%
We take inspiration from the computational model definitions of implicit
authentication, proposed by Guilhem~et~al.~\cite{DBLP:conf/csfw/GuilhemFW20}, to
modify classical injective agreement into an implicit property.
%
A small but important difference between our definition and theirs, is that
they focus on
authenticating a key and related identities, whereas we extend the more general
concept of agreeing on a set of parameters, starting from the idea of injective
agreement~\cite{DBLP:conf/csfw/Lowe97a}.
%
We use the term \emph{implicit} in this context to denote that a party $A$
assumes that any other party $B$ who knows the session key material \mSessKey{} must
be the intended party, and that $B$ (if honest) will also agree on a set
$S$ of parameters computed by the protocol, one of which is \mSessKey{}.
%
When implicit agreement holds for both roles, upon completion, $A$ is guaranteed
that $A$ has been or is engaged in exactly one protocol run with $B$ in the
opposite role, and that $B$ has been or will be able to agree on $S$.
%
The main difference to injective agreement is that $A$ concludes that if
$A$ sends the last message and this reaches $B$, then $A$ and $B$ have agreed
on $I$, $R$ and $S$.
%
%Injective agreement is asymmetric in the sense that the party receiving
%the last message can draw stronger conclusions than the party sending the last
%message, simply because the sender cannot know whether the intended receiver got
%the message or not.
%%
%Our implicit agreement does not suffer from this because it is conditional on
%that the message does reach the intended receiver.
%

%In particular, because the property only reasons about completed and
%hypothetically completed protocol runs, it can reason about parameters that the
%responder learns only after receiving the last message.
%
While almost full explicit key authentication, as defined by
Guilhem~et~al.~\cite{DBLP:conf/csfw/GuilhemFW20}, is a similar property, our
definition does not require key confirmation, so our definition is closer to
their definition of implicit authentication.
%
In the \mTamarin{} model we split the property into one lemma for
$I$ (\mPredImpI{}) and one for $R$ (\mPredImpR{}) to save memory during
verification.
%
We show only the definition for $I$ in Figure~\ref{fig:props}, because it is
symmetric to the one for $R$.
%

For implicit agreement to hold for the initiator $I$, the ephemeral keys
can never be revealed.
%
Intuitively, the reason for this is that the implicit agreement relies on that
whomever knows the session key material is the intended responder.
%
An adversary with access to the ephemeral keys and the public keys of
both parties can compute the session key material produced by all methods.
%
However, the responder $R$'s long-term key can be revealed after $I$ completes
its run, because the adversary is still unable to compute $P_e$.
%
The initiator's long-term key can also be revealed at any time without affecting
$I$'s guarantee for the same reason.

%------------------------------------------------------- Agreed parameters
\subsubsection{Agreed Parameters}
%\runhead{Agreed Parameters}
\label{sec:agreedParams}
The initiator $I$ gets injective and implicit agreement guarantees on the
following partial set $S_P$ of parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the roles played by itself and its peer,
    \item responder identity,
    \item session key material (which varies depending on \mEdhoc{} method),
    \item context identifiers \mCi{} and \mCr{}, and
    \item cipher suites \mSuites{}.
\end{itemize}
%
Because \mEdhoc{} aims to provide identity protection for $I$, there is no
injective agreement guarantee for $I$ that $R$ agrees on the initiator's
identity.
%
For the same reason, there is no such guarantee for $I$ with respect to
the $P_I$ part of the session key material when $I$ uses the \mStat{}
authentication method.
%
There is, however, an implicit agreement guarantee for $I$ that $R$ agrees on
$I$'s identity and the full session key material.
%
Since $R$ completes after $I$, $R$ can get injective agreement guarantees on
more parameters, namely also the initiator's identity and the full session key
material for all methods.
%
The full set of agreed parameters $S_F$ is $S_P \cup \{I, P_I\}$
when $P_I$ is
part of the session key material, and $S_P \cup \{I\}$ otherwise.
%

%------------------------------------------------------- Implied properties
\subsubsection{Inferred Properties}
%\runhead{Inferred Properties}
Given that the PFS and agreement properties
above hold, other properties can be inferred to hold in our adversary model.
%
Protocols where a party does not get confirmation that their peer knows the
session key material may be susceptible to
\emph{Key-Compromise Impersonation (KCI)}
attacks~\cite{DBLP:conf/ima/Blake-WilsonJM97}.
%
Attacks in this class allow an adversary in possession of a party $A$'s secret
long-term key to coerce $A$ to complete a
protocol run believing it authenticated a certain peer $B$, but where $B$ did
not engage with $A$ at all in a run.
%
Because both our notions of agreement above ensure agreement on identities,
roles and session key material, all methods passing verification of those are
also resistant to KCI attacks.
%

If a party $A$ can be coerced into believing it completed a run with $B$, but
where the session key material is actually shared with $C$ instead, the 
protocol is vulnerable to an \emph{Unknown Key-Share (UKS)}
attack~\cite{DBLP:conf/ima/Blake-WilsonJM97}.
%
For the same reason as for KCI, any method for which our agreement
properties hold is also resistant to UKS attacks.
%

From the injective agreement properties it follows that each party is assured
the identity of its peer upon completion.
%
Therefore, the agreement properties also capture \emph{entity authentication}.
%

%\mEdhoc{} claims to support mutual authentication with consistency, aliveness
%and peer awareness (see Section~\ref{sec:claimedProperties}).
%%
%These claims appear to have been imported from \mSigma{}~\cite{sigma}, using the
%inheritance argument, because all three appear there as well.
%%
%The definition of consistency~\cite{sigma} is very close in intent to the
%definition we use for implicit authentication, except that it is posed in a
%computational setting.
%%
%We therefore consider them equal in terms of intent for the purpose of this
%paper.
%%
%Aliveness is, according to \mSigma{}~\cite{sigma}, guaranteed to a party $A$ if
%after running the protocol with $B$, $A$ knows that $B$ was alive during
%the execution, e.g., by verifying that $B$ signed a challenge.
%%
%For \mEdhoc{} this means that if we can prove mutual injective agreement, i.e.,
%explicit authentication, on \mGxy{}, then mutual aliveness follows.
%%
%Peer awareness is informally defined in~\cite{sigma} as the guarantee
%that if $A$ completes a protocol run with $B$, then not only does $A$
%know that $B$ is alive, but also that $B$ has initiated a corresponding session
%with $A$.
%

\subsection{\mTamarin{}}
\label{sec:tamarin}
% \knote{FOR PFS: It turns out that Tamarin's logic does not allow formulas of the form:
%     $(A \lor B) \rightarrow C$, so I cannot make the Tamarin model match the
%     formula above. The Tamarin model still uses one event type to represent that
%     either $I$ or $R$ completed.  One way of solving this is to say here in the
%     paper that we define a new event type $\mathbf{Comp} =
%     \mIComplete \lor \mRComplete$. That is exactly what is going on anyway.
% }
We chose \mTamarin{} to model and verify \mEdhoc{} in the symbolic model.
%
\mTamarin{} is an interactive verification tool in which models are specified
as multi-set rewrite rules that define a transition relation.
%
The elements of the multi-sets are called facts and represent the global system
state.
%
Rules are equipped with event annotations called actions. Sequences of actions make up the execution trace.
%
These actions allow the user to check logic formulas on models.
%
%The logic used is a fragment of temporal first order logic.
%

Multi-set rewrite rules with actions are written\\ $ l \ifarrow[e] r $,
where $l$ and $r$ are multi-sets of facts, and $e$ is a multi-set of actions.
%
% Facts and actions are $n$-ary predicates over a term algebra, which defines a
% set of function symbols $\mathcal F$, variables $\mathcal V$ and names
% $\mathcal N$.
Facts and actions are $n$-ary predicates over a term algebra, which defines a
set of function symbols, variables and names.
%
\mTamarin{} checks equality of these terms under an equational theory $E$.
%
For example, one can write $ dec(enc(x,y),y) =_E x $
to denote that symmetric decryption reverses the encryption operation under
this theory.
%
The equational theory $E$ is fixed per model, and hence we omit the subscript.
%
\mTamarin{} supports let-bindings and tuples as syntactic sugar to simplify
model definitions.
%
It also provides built-in rules for Dolev-Yao adversaries and for
managing their knowledge.
%
We implement events using actions, and parameters associated with events using
terms of the algebra.
%

%To simplify the exposition, we do not describe the model in full detail, but
%all the \mTamarin{} code can be found in~\cite{edhocTamarinRepo}.
%

%\runhead{Semantics and Built-ins}
%%\subsubsection{Semantics and Built-ins} \phantom{} 
%\mTamarin{} states
%$S$, $S'$ are multisets of facts, and a semantic transition of the form $S \semarrow[E] S'$
%occurs if there is a rule $l \ifarrow[e] r$ and a substitution $\sigma$ such
%that $S \supseteq \sigma(l)$ and $S' = S \setminus \sigma(l) \uplus \sigma(r)$
%and $E = \sigma(e)$.
%
%There are a few more details, such as persistent facts which are denoted by a $!$
%and are never removed from the state.
%%
%The sorts fresh (denoted by $\sim$) and public (denoted by $\$$) denote fresh
%constants and public values known to the attacker respectively, and are both
%sub-sorts of a base sort.
%%
%Finally, \mTamarin{} has some built-in predicates ($\mIn,
%\mOut$ to represent input and output of messages with the attacker,
%and
%$\mFr$ to denote a fresh constant created in the current rule, among
%others), rules and equations that represent the attacker's knowledge
%and standard equational theories in the symbolic model,
%which we present later.

%\anote{This can go, I make a shorter note later:
%{Notational conventions} In the remainder of this section we present
%\mTamarin{} code as it appears in the models that we verify, in the style of
%literate programming.  Whenever possible we match the style of the protocol
%diagrams in Section~\ref{sec:edhoc} and the naming convention of the \mEdhoc{}
%\mSpec~\cite{selander-lake-edhoc-01}, so that each element of the model is
%traceable to the standard.  There are a few exceptions to this, most notably
%some variable names that we introduce for the sake of the \mTamarin{} model and are
%not present in the original \mSpec{}, which will appear in \mT{camelCase}, and
%the syntax for Diffie-Hellman exponentiation which is specific to \mTamarin{}.
%We also use \mT{xx} to name the ephemeral key for the initiator (resp. \mT{yy}
%for the responder) as to avoid confusion with \mTamarin's builtin variable
%names \mT{x} and \mT{y}.}

%\runhead{Protocol Rules and Equations}
\subsubsection{Protocol Rules and Equations}
\mTamarin{} allows users to define new function symbols and equational theories.
rules, which are added to the set of considered rules during verification.
For example, in our model we have a symbol to denote authenticated encryption,
for which \mTamarin{} produces a rule of the following form:
%
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
[!KU(k), !KU(m), !KU(ad), !KU(ai)] --[]->
    [!KU(aeadEncrypt(k, m, ad, ai))]
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
%
to denote that if the adversary knows a key \mT{k}, a message \mT{m}, the
authenticated data \mT{ad}, and an algorithm \mT{ai}, then they can construct
the encryption, and thus get to know the message
\mT{aeadEncrypt(k, m, ad, ai)}.
%

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------- sub
\subsection{\mTamarin{} Encoding of \mEdhoc{}}
\label{sec:modeling}
%In this section we detail the modeling choices that we have made for this formal
%verification effort.
%
We model all four methods of \mEdhoc{}, namely
\mSigSig, \mSigStat, \mStatSig{} and \mStatStat.
%
Because the methods share a lot of common structure, we derive
their \mTamarin-models from a single specification written with the aid of the
M4 macro language.
%
%Whenever possible we adhere with the variable names present in the \mSpec{} and
%in Section~\ref{sec:edhoc}.
%%
%There are a few exceptions: we use \mT{camelCase} for names introduced in the
%modeling, and we use \mT{xx} and \mT{yy} for the ephemeral keys, to avoid name clashes.
%
To keep the presentation brief, we only present the \mStatSig{} metohod, as it
illustrates the use of two different asymmetric authentication methods
simultaneously.
%
The full \mTamarin{} code for all models can be found at~\cite{edhocTamarinRepo}.
%
Variable names used in the code excerpts here are sometimes shortened compared
to the model itself to fit the paper format.
%

%\anote{Fix: give a dropbox link instead of the repo}
%

\subsubsection{Primitive Operations}
%\runhead{Primitive Operations}
Our model uses the built-in theories of exclusive-or and DH operations, as
in~\cite{DBLP:conf/csfw/DreierHRS18,DBLP:conf/csfw/SchmidtMCB12}.
%
Hashing is modeled via the built-in hashing function symbol augmented
with a public constant as additional input, modelling different
hash functions.
%
%Due to not modeling error messages, the selected hash function is fixed.
%
The HKDF interface is represented by \mT{expa} for the
expansion operation and \mT{extr} for the extraction operation.
%
Signatures use \mTamarin's built-in theory for \mT{sign} and \mT{verify}
operations.
%
%The XOR theory introduces the symbol \mT{XOR}, plus the necessary equational theory including associativity, commutativity, and inverse.
%
%The Diffie-Hellman theory introduces exponentiation \mT{g^y} and product of exponents \mT{x * y} as built-in symbols in the language, plus the necessary equational theory of associativity, commutativity, distributivity of exponentiation with product, and inverse.
%
For \mAead{} operations on key \mT{k}, message \mbox{\mT{m}}, additional data \mT{ad}
and algorithm identifier \mT{ai}, we use \mT{aeadEncrypt(m, k, ad, ai)}
for encryption.
%
Decryption with verification of the integrity is defined via the equation
\begin{small}\begin{verbatim}
aeadDecrypt(aeadEncrypt(m, k, ad, ai),
    k, ad, ai) = m.
\end{verbatim}\end{small}
%
The integrity protection of AEAD covers \mT{ad}, and this equation hence requires
an adversary to know \mT{ad} even if they only wish to decrypt the data.
%
To enable the adversary to decrypt without needing to verify the integrity
we add the equation
\begin{small}\begin{verbatim}
decrypt(aeadEncrypt(m, k, ad, ai), k, ai) = m.
\end{verbatim}\end{small}
%
The latter equation is not used by honest parties.
%

\subsubsection{Protocol Environment and Adversary Model}
%\runhead{Protocol Environment and Adversary Model}
We model the binding between a party's identity and their longt-term
key pairs using the following rules.
%
%\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
rule registerLTK_SIG:
    [Fr(~ltk)] --[UniqLTK($A, ~ltk)]->
        [!LTK_SIG($A, ~ltk),
         !PK_SIG($A, pk(~ltk)),
         Out(<$A, pk(~ltk)>)]
rule registerLTK_STAT:
    [Fr(~ltk)] --[UniqLTK($A, ~ltk)]->
        [!LTK_STAT($A, ~ltk),
         !PK_STAT($A, 'g'^~ltk),
         Out(<$A, 'g'^~ltk>)]
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
%\end{lstlisting}
%
The rules \mT{registerLTK\_SIG} and \mT{registerLTK\_STAT} register a longt-term
key pair for the \mSig{}- and \mStat{}-based methods respectively.
%
The fact \verb|Fr(~ltk)| creates a fresh term \mT{ltk}, representing a long-term
secret key, which is not known to the adversary.
%
The fact \verb|Out(<$A, pk(~ltk)>)| sends the identity of the party
owning the long-term key and the corresponding public key to the adversary.
%
The event \mT{UniqLTK} together with a corresponding restriction models the fact
that the each party is associated with exactly one long-term key.
%
Consequently, an adversary cannot register additional long-term keys for an
identity.
%
% or pair of agents, as enforced by the following restriction:
% \begin{lstlisting}
% restriction uniqLTKs:
%     "All id k1 k2 #i #j. (UniqLTK(id, k1)@i & UniqLTK(id, k2)@j) ==> k1 = k2"
% \end{lstlisting}
In line with the \mEdhoc{} \mSpec{}, this models an external mechanism
ensuring that long term keys are bound to correct identities, e.g., as
managed by a certificate authority.
%

We rely on \mTamarin's{} built-in message deduction rules for a Dolev-Yao adversary.
%
To model an adversary compromising long-term keys, i.e., events of type
\mRevLTK{}, and revealing ephemeral keys, i.e., events of type
\mRevEph{}, we use standard reveal rules.
%
% \begin{lstlisting}
% rule revealLTK_SIG:
%     [!LTK_SIG($A, ~ltk)] --[LTKRev($A)]-> [Out(~ltk)]
% rule revealLTK_STAT:
%     [!LTK_STAT($A, ~ltk)] --[LTKRev($A)]-> [Out(~ltk)]
% rule revealEphKey:
%     [CompletedRevEph(~tid, u, v, sk, ~eph)] --[EphKeyRev(sk)]-> [Out(~eph)]
% \end{lstlisting}
%rule forge_SIG: [!LTK_SIG($A, ~ltk), In(xx)] --[TEE($A)]-> [Out(sign(xx, ~ltk))]
%rule exp_STAT: [!LTK_STAT($A, ~ltk), In('g'^x)] --[TEE($A)]-> [Out(('g'^x)^~ltk)]
%
The timing of reveals as modelled by these events is important.
%
The long-term keys can be revealed on registration, before protocol execution.
%
The ephemeral key of a party can be revealed when the party completes,
i.e., at events of type \mIComplete{} and \mRComplete.~\footnote{A stronger, and perhaps more realistic, model would reveal ephemeral keys upon
creation at the start of the run, but we failed to get \mTamarin{} to
terminate on this.}
%
% \knote{Most state-of-the-art Tamarin models of real-world protocols
%         (involving DH) do not
%         reveal the actual session key used for the secure channel, e.g., Cremers
%         et~al.~\cite{DBLP:conf/ccs/CremersFKN20}, Girol
%         et~al.~\cite{DBLP:conf/uss/GirolHSJCB20}. Similarly to us, they instead
%         only leak the session state (only ephemeral keys in out case).  We had
%         serious problems getting Tamarin to terminate if leaking actual session
%         key. Is this a common problem in Tamarin?  "All" computational models
%         have session key reveal queries. CK and eCK have session state (eph-key)
%         reveal queries as well.
%     }
%These rules allow to check Perfect Forward Secrecy, Key Compromise Impersonation
%and (weak) Post Compromise Security as defined in Section~\ref{sec:desired-properties},
%by giving the attacker the ability to access to long term and session keys, or
%to the cryptographic interface, at the appropriate time.

\subsubsection{Protocol Roles}
We model each method of the protocol with four rules: \mT{I1}, \mT{R2}, \mT{I3}
and \mT{R4} (with the method suffixed to the rule name).
%
Each of these represent one step of the protocol as run by the initiator $I$
or the responder $R$.
%
The rules correspond to the event types \mIStart, \mRStart, \mIComplete,  and
\mRComplete, respectively.%, and they can be traced back to the diagrams of
%Figure~\ref{fig:edhocsigstat} and the more general
%Figure~\ref{fig:edhocFramework}.
%
Facts prefixed with \mT{StI} carry state information between \mT{I1} and \mT{I3}.
%
A term unique to the current thread, \mT{tid}, links two rules to a given state fact.
%
Similarly, facts prefixed with \mT{StR} carry state information between the
responder role's rules.
%
Line 28 in the \mT{R2\_STAT\_SIG} rule shown below illustrate one such use of state
facts.
%

%Our model differs slightly from the \mSpec{}.
%%
%In particular, for convenience we divide the \mMethod{} element into two
%elements, representing the method for the initiator and the responder without
%reducing the attacker potential.
%
We do not model the error message that $R$ can send in response to message
\mMsgone, and hence our model does not
capture the possibility for $R$ to reject $I$'s offer.
%

%We model the XOR encryption of \mT{CIPHERTEXT_2} with the key \mT{K_2e} as to
%allow recovering of part of the key for known plaintext.
%
%Hence \mT{CIPHERTEXT_2} is not a direct XOR ``encryption'' in the model, but
%rather a tuple where each field is XORed with a half-key expansion (\mT{K_2e_1}
%and \mT{K_2e_2}).
We model the XOR encryption of \mT{CIPHERTEXT\_2} with the key \mT{K\_2e} using
\mTamarin{}'s built in theory for XOR, and allow each term of the encrypted
element to be attacked individually.
%
That is, we first expand \mT{K\_2e} to as many key-stream terms as there are
terms in the plaintext tuple by applying the \mHkdfExpand{} function to unique
inputs per term.
%
We then XOR each term in the plaintext with its own key-stream term.
%
This models the \mSpec{} closer than if we would have XORed \mT{K\_2e} as a
single term onto the plaintext tuple.
%
The XOR encryption can be seen in lines 19--22 in the listing of
\mT{R2\_STAT\_SIG} below.
%
%In the latest version of the \mEdhoc{}
%specification~\cite{latest-ietf-lake-edhoc-03}, the XOR-based encryption
%has been changed into using the encryption algorithm from the AEAD algorithm
%from \mSuites{}.

%

To implement events and
to bind them to parameters, we use actions.
%
For example, the action \verb|ExpRunningR(~tid, $V, exp_sk, agreed)| in line 27
above implements binding of an event of type \mRStart{} to the parameters and session key
material.% for the purpose of injective agreement.
%

As explained in Section~\ref{sec:agreedParams}, it is not possible to show
injective agreement on session key material when it includes
$P_I$ (not visible in the rule \mT{R2\_STAT\_SIG}).
%
Therefore, we use certain actions to implement events that include $P_I$ in the
session key material and other actions that do not.
%
Session key material which includes (resp. does not include) $P_I$ is referred
to as \mT{imp\_sk} (resp. \mT{exp\_sk}) in the
\mTamarin{} model.
%
In the case of \mSigSig{} and \mSigStat, therefore, \mT{imp\_sk} is the same as
\mT{exp\_sk}.
%

%We model the session key material differently for implicit authentication and
%explicit authentication.
%%
%Specifically, when the initiator uses the \mStat{} authentication method,
%\mT{impSk} includes the semi-static key \mGiy{}, whereas \mT{expSk} does not
%include it.
%%
%The reason for this is that, when sending the second message \mMsgtwo{}, the
%responder does not yet know the identity of the initiator and hence cannot
%indicate knowledge of \mGiy{} to the initiator.
%%
%Because we want to verify strong properties such as explicit authentication
%when possible, we collect those items in the key material referred to as
%\mT{exp_k}.
%%
%When not possible we prove weaker properties for \mT{impSk}, which excludes
%key material which it is even theoretically impossible to get explicit
%authentication on.
%%

%What happens after a run of \mEdhoc{} completes is beyond the scope of our study, hence
%we have left this part out of the modeling and focus on the key material
%that forms the basis for the \mOscore{} security context.
%%

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------- sub
\subsection{Property Formalization}
\label{sec:propertyFormalization}
The properties and adversary model we defined in
Section~\ref{sec:desired-properties} translate directly into \mTamarin's logic,
using the straightforward mapping of events to the actions emitted from the model.
%
As an example, we show the lemma for verifying the property \mPredPfs.
%
%\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
1 lemma secrecyPFS:
2 all-traces
3  "All u v sk #t3 #t2.
4   (K(sk)@t3 & CompletedRun(u, v, sk)@t2) ==>
5       ( (Ex #t1. LTKRev(u)@t1 & #t1 < #t2)
6       | (Ex #t1. LTKRev(v)@t1 & #t1 < #t2)
7       | (Ex #t1. EphKeyRev(sk)@t1))"
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
%\end{lstlisting}
%
As mentioned earlier, the action \mT{CompletedRun(u, v, sk)} in line 4 is
emitted by both the rules \mT{I3} and \mT{R4}, and corresponds
to the disjunction of events $\mIComplete^{t_2} \lor \mRComplete^{t_2}$ in the
definition of \mPredPfs{} in Section~\ref{sec:secrecy}.
%
Similarly, \mT{EphKeyRev(sk)} in line 7 models that the ephemeral
key is revealed for either $I$ or $R$, or both.
%

%In this section we present our formalization of the security properties. %into
%%\mTamarin{} lemmas.
%%
%We refer to Section~\ref{sec:desired-properties} for a full explanation of the
%properties.
%

%\runhead{Explicit Authentication}
%We model explicit authentication between the initiator and the
%responder in the form of mutual injective agreement on the session key material,
%and on the roles and identities of the two parties.
%%
%We split the property into two lemmas, one for authenticating the responder to the
%initiator, and one for the other direction.
%%
%For the first case, we use the action facts \mT{ExpCommitI} and
%\mT{ExpRunningR}, and show that there is injective agreement
%between the two action facts on the parameters identities \mT{U} and \mT{V},
%their respective roles,  and the session key material \mT{expSk}.
%%
%The key material differs between \mEdhoc{} methods.
%%

%Additionally, we require that injective agreement must hold only when
%no long-term key material for the two parties has been revealed before
%the initiator completes the protocol run.
%%
%This is covered by the main disjunction in lines 10-12 on the right of
%the implication.
%%
%That is, either we have injective agreement or one of
%the three \mT{LtkRev} action facts must have been generated.
%%

%The initiator is the first to complete the protocol run and confirms that
%it knows both parties identities, their roles (based on message types) and the
%session key in the third message.
%%
%In particular, the initiator knows the responder's identity, so even if the
%responder uses the \mStat{} authentication, the knowledge asymmetry that caused
%problems for injective agreement on \mGiy{} does not occur for \mGrx{}.
%%
%Therefore, the responder gets injective agreement guarantees, and hence explicit
%authentication guarantees, for the entire session key material.
%%
%Consequently, we do not need to differentiate the explicit session key from the
%implicit session key in this case and can ignore the \mT{Exp} prefix for the
%running and commit action facts (\mT{RunningI} and \mT{CommitR} respectively).

%%\subsubsection{Secrecy, Forward Secrecy and Session Key Independence}
%\runhead{Secrecy, Forward Secrecy and Session Key Independence}
%Finally, we prove secrecy of session key material, perfect forward secrecy
%(PFS) and session key material independence.
%%
%All these properties are verified by proving the same lemma for each method,
%as secrecy is a strictly weaker property than PFS (and hence follows
%directly), and session key independence can be proven along PFS.
%%
%This is done by allowing the attacker to reveal long-term keys after either
%the initiator or the responder have completed the protocol, and by
%allowing the attacker to reveal session key material.
%%
%Despite these additional attacker capabilities, it still holds that the session
%key material is secret for all the other runs of the protocol.
