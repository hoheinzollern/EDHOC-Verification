%The high-level goal of \mEdhoc{} is to establish an authenticated security
%context for the \mOscore{} security protocol.
%
%To reach this goal, 
To establish an authenticated security context for \mOscore,
\mEdhoc{} uses a three-message protocol structure
%in the style of the \mNoise{} framework, outlined in
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:edhocFramework}.
%
In the first message \mMsgone{}, the initiator ($I$) sends to the responder ($R$) an
ephemeral DH half-key \mGx{} and, in the \mMethod{} element, suggests
authentication methods to be used.
%
$R$ may reject the choice of authentication methods.
%
In the second message \mMsgtwo{}, $R$ provides its ephemeral
DH half-key \mGy{} and authenticates itself to $I$ by
providing authentication data \mAuthr{}.
%
Finally, in the third message \mMsgthree{}, $I$ authenticates itself
to $R$ by providing authentication data \mAuthi{}.
%
The authentication data consists of a MAC for all authentication methods.
%
This MAC is also signed when authentication is based on public key signatures.
%
In addition to the exchange of DH half-keys and authentication data, the
messages also include parameters for the \mOscore{} security context, such as
encryption algorithm identifiers (\mSuites{}) and \mOscore{} security context
identifiers \mCi{} and \mCr{}.
%
Optionally, messages may also include application layer data \mAD{}, which
enjoys differing levels of protection depending on which message it is part of.
%
%As will be described below, 
When authentication is based on
a pre-shared key, the \mCredi{} and \mCredr{} credential identifiers are not
used.
%
Instead, a single identifier for the pre-shared key is transmitted in \mMsgone{}.

\end{figure}

%One of the driving design goals is to 
\mEdhoc{} accommodates three credential types
a party may use for authentication -- certificates, private keys
and static long-term DH keys.
%
Depending on the types used, the authentication methods may differ,
and \mAuthi{} and \mAuthr{} need to be constructed accordingly.
%
The three authentication methods are based on digital signatures (\mSig),
challenge-response signatures based on static long-term DH keys (\mStat) and
pre-shared symmetric keys (\mPsk).
%
The two parties may use different authentication methods in an \mEdhoc{} run.
%
While any combination of the \mSig{} and \mStat{} methods is possible,
when \mPsk{} is used, both parties must use \mPsk{}.
%
We refer to these \emph{combinations} of authentication methods as
\emph{methods} to follow the terminology in the \mSpec{}.
%
Thus, we have five methods: \mSigSig, \mSigStat, \mStatStat, \mStatSig{} and
\mPskPsk.
%
The first method in a name denotes the
authentication method used by the initiator of the protocol run and the second denotes the
one used by the responder.
%
We refer to a method where at least one party uses \mSig{} (resp. \mStat) as a \mSig-based (resp. \mStat-based)
method.
%and similarly for \mStat{} and \mPsk.
%

%We first briefly discuss \mEdhoc's relations to the protocols on which it is
%based before providing details about the methods.
%

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
\subsection{Relation to \mSigma, \mOptls{}, and \mNoise{}}
\label{sec:relationsToOtherProtocols}
We now present how \mEdhoc{} uses \mSigma, \mOptls{}, and \mNoise{} as cryptographic cores for various methods, and the ways in which it differs from them. \\

%\mEdhoc{} uses existing academic protocols as cryptographic cores to
%establish the session key.
%
%Being designed as an industrial standard, \mEdhoc{} specifies more details
%on top of these cores, e.g., connection identifiers for message multiplexing,
%encoding and application specific parameters to be negotiated.
%
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\runhead{\mSigma{}}
%\subsubsection{\mSigma{}.}
%\label{sec:sigma}
The \mSigSig{} method of \mEdhoc{} is closely modeled on the \mSigma{}
variant that provides identity protection for the initiator~\cite{sigma}.
%
Some aspects differ though, e.g., \mSigSig{} uses Mac-then-Sign like
\mTls{} instead of Sign-then-Mac. 
%
\\
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
%\subsubsection{\mOptls{}.}
%\label{sec:optls}
\runhead{\mOptls{}}
The \mStat-based methods use challenge-response signatures based on static
long-term DH keys, and proceed along the lines of
\mOptls~\cite{DBLP:conf/eurosp/KrawczykW16}.
%
%The challenge-response signature works by one party sending a random challenge
The challenge-response works as follows.
%One party sends a random challenge
Party $A$ sends a random challenge $r$
%and an ephemeral DH half-key to a receiver.
and an ephemeral DH half-key $e$ to a party $B$.
%
%The receiver mixes the DH half-key and the challenge with its secret static DH
$B$ mixes $e$ and $r$ with its secret static DH
key $s$ to obtain a temporary key, which
%
is used to compute a MAC that is returned to 
%the sender of the challenge.
$A$.
%
%This authenticates the receiver to the sender, which is sufficient for \mOptls,
This authenticates $B$ to $A$, which is sufficient for \mOptls, 
because it only considers server authentication, where the server acts as $B$
and the client as $A$.
%
The temporary key also affects the final session key.
%

In \mEdhoc, a party using the \mStat{} authentication method
essentially acts as an \mOptls{} client and the peer as an \mOptls{}
server.
%
However, unlike \mOptls{}, \mEdhoc{} requires mutual
authentication~\cite{ietf-lake-reqs-04}.
%
\mStatStat{} can be thought of as interleaving two \mOptls{}
runs, one initiated by each party, and then combining the resulting session key
material.
%
Also, in \mOptls{}, 
$e$ and $r$
%
are distinct elements, following the separation of concerns principle,
\knote{I think the point on separation of concerns is useful in that it
    explains why this is the case and motivates the need for our work:
    the change \mEdhoc{} made cannot improve security, only weaken it, so
    verification is needed to show everything is still OK.
}
\knote{change separation of concerns to explanation of the concept instead (see
previous note.}

\\
%------------------------------------------------------------------------- sub
 
%\subsubsection{\mNoise{}.}
\runhead{\mNoise{}}
The \mStatStat{} and \mPskPsk{} methods follow the \mNoise{}
framework~\cite{perrin2016noise}.
%
\mNoise{} defines how to construct AKE protocols, using static long-term DH
keys or pre-shared keys as credentials.
%
Its goal is to use so-called patterns to harmonize the many static long-term
key DH-based AKE protocols, of which \mOptls{} is one.
%
\mNoise{} specifies how to derive keys, use transcript hashes to ensure
authentication of the message flow etc.
%among other things.
%
The \mNoise{} pattern closest to the \mStatStat{} method is called XX.
%
However, \mEdhoc{} does not use the functions of \mNoise{} exactly as
prescribed, and thus cannot automatically inherit the properties enjoyed by XX.
%prevents claiming that security properties of XX
%automatically carries over. 
\knote{Is the above sentence correct now?  It depends on what it means to
    automatically inherit something. It is clear that one cannot \emph{claim}
    automatically inheriting the properties without checking. But: it is not clear
    to me that it is impossible that \mEdhoc{} is equal to \mNoise{} in the
    parts that are relevant for automatic inheritance (whatever that means).
}
\vnote{An ``automatic'' inheritance means nothing needs to be verified to see that the two protocols are equal. Here obviously that is not the case. We can rewrite that if you want.}
%
\knote{change to that it is not obvious that it inherits.}

For example, according to \mNoise{}, the mixHash function is called on
pre-message public keys during the initialization.
%
This would correspond to \mEdhoc{} computing a first intermediate transcript
hash over those keys, which \mEdhoc{} does not do.
%

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- sub
 
\subsection{Methods of \mEdhoc{}}
\label{sec:methods}
 
%We are now ready to dive into the various methods of \mEdhoc.
Although \mCbor{} and \mCose{}~\cite{rfc8152} are important building blocks of
\mEdhoc{}, and we use their terminology in our \mTamarin{} model to better
reflect the \mSpec{}, our model does not cover the details of encoding and
\mCose{} interfaces.
%
Thus, we omit details about \mCbor{} and \mCose{}.
%
All methods make use of a common key hierarchy, which we describe first.
%
\\

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- sub
%\subsubsection{Key Hierarchy.}
%\label{sec:keyHierarchy}
\runhead{Key Hierarchy}
\mEdhoc{} derives keys using \mHkdf{}~\cite{rfc5869}.
%
The \mHkdf{} interface provides two functions -- \mHkdfExtract{}, which
constructs uniformly distributed key material from random input and a seed,
and \mHkdfExpand{}, which generates keys from key material and a seed.
%
The seeds are used to bind the key material and keys to certain parameters.
%
Derived keys (\mKtwoe, \mKtwom{}, \mKthreeae, and \mKthreem) are then used as
input to encryption and integrity protection algorithms.
%

The key hierarchy is rooted in the ephemeral DH key \mGxy{}, the combination
of the two half-keys \mGx{} and \mGy{}.
%
From this, keys are successively constructed with each transmitted message,
weaving in information parties learn as the protocol progresses, culminating
in the established session key material.
%
From the session key material, a key exporter (\mEdhoc-Exporter) based on
\mHkdf{} can be used to extract the encryption and integrity keys required
for \mOscore{}.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:kdfdiagram} shows an abstract description of the key hierarchy.
%

From \mGxy{}, three intermediate keys \mPRKtwo, \mPRKthree{} and
\mPRKthree{} are derived.
%
Each one of them corresponds to a specific message in the protocol, and from
these intermediate keys, encryption and integrity keys for that message are
derived.
%
For \mPskPsk{}, the pre-shared key is used as seed for \mPRKtwo.
%
For all other methods the seed for \mPRKtwo{} is empty.
%
In the \mPskPsk{} and \mSigSig{} methods, all three intermediate keys
are the same, i.e., $\mPRKtwo{} = \mPRKthree{} = \mPRKfour$.
%
For the three \mStat-based methods, however, they differ.
%
This is because the intermediate key \mPRKthree{} is dependent on the static
long-term key of the party (or parties, if both) using \mStat{}-based
authentication.
%

\begin{figure}[!h]
\scalebox{.75}{
\input{kdfdiagram.tex}
}
\caption{Joint key hierarchy for all methods}
\label{fig:kdfdiagram}
\end{figure}

We now describe the \mEdhoc{} methods.
%
Since the \mSigSig{} method has been analyzed earlier, we do not focus on
it here.
%
For brevity, we only describe the \mStat-based methods here.
%
However, a detailed description of the \mPskPsk{} method can be found in the
technical report at~\cite{edhocTamarinRepo}. 
%

%\subsubsection{\mPskPsk{}.}
%In this method, the initiator and responder are assumed to share a pre-shared
%key (\mPsk) identified by \mIDPsk.
%%
%The message sequence is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:edhocpsk}.
%%
%The first message contains the \mIDPsk{} identifier.
%%
%The responder obtains the corresponding \mPsk{} and uses that to construct the
%authentication data, i.e., the MAC in the \mAead{} transform), included in
%the second message.
%%
%In the third message, the initiator uses this same technique to authenticate
%to the responder.
%%
%
%The transcript hash \mTH{} keeps track of the data sent in the messages.
%%
%One unconventional feature is that the transcript hash lags behind by one
%message.
%%
%That is, the second transcript hash \mTHtwo{}, does not cover the content of
%the second message (similarly for \mTHthree).
%%
%The reason for this is that \mTHtwo{} cannot cover the output of the
%\mAead{} transform, since \mTHtwo{} is itself an input to it.
%%
%This is the same for all methods, but it does not cause any problems with
%authentication, since the data not covered by the transcript hash is
%instead MACed or signed.
%%

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- sub
%\subsubsection{\mStat-based Methods.}
\mEdhoc{} provides three \mStat-based methods -- \mSigStat{}, \mStatStat{} and
\mStatSig{}.
%
One or both of the initiator and responder authenticate to their peer using
their secret static long-term DH key, \mLtki{} or \mLtkr{} respectively.
%
Authentication is achieved using challenge-response signatures that work as
follows when the responder authenticates to the initiator.
%
Each party provides an identifier, \mIdcredi{} and \mIdcredr{} respectively,
for the credentials they use.
%

The initiator sends the ephemeral DH half-key \mGx{} as a challenge to the
responder in the first message.
%
%To save bandwidth,  sent in the first message also serves as challenge.
%
Upon receiving \mGx{}, the responder raises it to \mLtkr{}.
\knote{What is described here seems to be
    \mSigStat{}, not a general description of all the \mEdhoc{} (or even all the
    \mStat{}-based methods). Something needs fixing here. We could refer back to
    the description of challenge-response signatures to save space.
    Todo.
}
\vnote{Actually all of what is described here and in the following paragraph has already been captured in your new introduction paragraph to section 2. We could just refer back (``As mentioned earlier...'')}
\knote{refer back to beginning of section 2 + description of challenge-response
signs}
%
Assuming the discrete log problem is hard in the underlying DH group,
only the initiator and responder will be able to compute $\mGx{}^\mLtkr{}$,
and this value is woven in to the key hierarchy as depicted in
Figures~\ref{fig:kdfdiagram} and \ref{fig:edhocsigstat}.
%
The responder computes authentication data \mAuthr{} in the form of \mMactwo{}
using the \mAead{} transform from \mSuites{} as proposed by the
initiator in the first message.
%
The responder then includes \mMactwo{} in the second message.
%
Knowing the secret ephemeral DH half-key corresponding to \mGx{}, and the public
static long-term half-key of the responder, the initiator can also
compute $\mGx{}^\mLtkr{}$.

%
The initiator assumes that only the responder knows $\mGx{}^\mLtkr{}$, and
therefore considers the responder authenticated if the \mAead{} transform
completes successfully.
%
When the initiator is authenticating to the responder, the roles are reversed,
and \mGy, \mLtki, and \mAuthi{} are used instead of \mGx, \mLtkr, and \mAuthr{}
respectively. 
%\mGy{} takes the place of \mGx{}, \mLtki{} that of \mLtkr{}, and \mAuthi{}
%that of \mAuthr{}. 
\mAuthi{} is constructed from \mMacthree{}.
%

Even if one party uses \mStat{}-based authentication, the
other party may use \mSig{}-based authentication, where the authentication data
is constructed using a regular signature. \\
%
%In contrast to the \mPskPsk{} method, in \mStat{}-based methods, each party provides an identifier, \mIdcredi{} and \mIdcredr{} respectively, for the credentials they use.
%
%------------------------------------------------------------------------- sub
 
%\subsubsection{\mSigStat.}
\runhead{\mSigStat}
The initiator uses the \mSig{} method, authenticating with a signature,
while the responder uses the \mStat{} method, authenticating with a
challenge-response signature.
%
The detailed message sequence chart is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:edhocsigstat}.
%
\mCredi{} and \mLtki{} must be signature keys since the initiator is using the
\mSig{} method.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- sub
 
\runhead{\mStatStat}
Both the initiator and the responder use the \mStat{}
authentication method.
%
Both parties' secret static long-term DH keys feed into the key hierarchy.
%
The initiator computes authentication data using the \mAead{} transform
and includes that in the third message for the responder to verify.
%
%As expected, the initiator's behavior mirrors the \mStat{} authentication method used by the responder in \mSigStat{}.
%

% 
%\subsubsection{\mSigSig{}.}
%Both parties run \mSig{} and authenticate with signatures.
%%
%As mentioned earlier, \mSigSig{} is very closely modeled on \mSigmaI{}, but
%there are some notable differences.
%%
%For example, \mEdhoc{} aims to provide some degree of identity protection for
%responders, and therefore uses the idea from \mSigmaI{} of encrypting the
%responder identifier \mIdcredr{} (and other items) in the second message.
%%
%The designers of \mEdhoc{} consider it wasteful adding a second MAC in addition
%to the already included \mMactwo{}, to limit bandwidth consumption.
%%
%\mEdhoc{} applies XOR encryption, with \mHkdf{} being used to generate the
%key stream, whereas \mSigma{} assumes authenticated encryption for this
%purpose (see Section 5.2 of~\cite{sigma}).
%%
%Because \mSigSig{} has been analyzed in~\cite{DBLP:conf/secsr/BruniJPS18}, we
%do not focus on it here.
%%
%However, we model it and verify its properties as carefully as for the other methods.


%KARL: we didn't verify anything about this after all. Propose to delete it.

%\subsection{Negotiating a cipher suite and method and correlation parameters}
%\label{sec:ciphersuite}
%Recall that we mentioned that the first message contains a list of cipher suites, ranked according to the preference of the initiator. What does a cipher suite actually contain? An \mEdhoc{} cipher suite consists of an ordered set of \mCose{} algorithms: an \mAead{} algorithm, a hash algorithm, an ECDH curve, a signature algorithm, a signature algorithm curve, an application \mAead{} algorithm, and an application hash algorithm from the \mCose{} Algorithms and Elliptic Curves registries.  
%
%There are four supported cipher suites in \mEdhoc{} -- we refer the reader to Section 3.4 of~\cite{selander-lake-edhoc-01} for the specifics of the algorithms allowed therein. Each cipher suite is identified by one of four predefined integer labels (0--3). Some algorithms are not used in some methods.  The signature algorithm and the signature algorithm curve are not used in methods without signature authentication (i.e. in \mPskPsk{} and \mStatStat).
%
%In order to keep the presentation clean, we have omitted the cipher suite negotiation process from the description of the methods. However, this process happens as follows, at the beginning of every method, once the responder receives the first message. The initiator proposes an ordered list of cipher suites they support. This list presented in descending order to the responder who either accepts the topmost entry in this list (if they also support that suite) or makes a counter-proposal, namely the topmost entry which they support from the remaining part of the list. If there is no such entry the responder can reject, and the protocol does not continue. Similarly, the responder can reject the initiator's choices for the method and correlation parameters as well -- in the case of a reject for either of these values, the protocol aborts.

\subsection{Claimed Security Properties}
\label{sec:claimedProperties}
 
We present the security properties that the authors
of the \mSpec{}~\cite{selander-lake-edhoc-01} claim \mEdhoc{} satisfies.
%
Many of the claims are imprecisely expressed.
%
We will revisit these claims when we discuss the formal modeling and
verification of \mEdhoc{} in Section~\ref{sec:formalization} and in the
discussions in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.
\knote{Remember to refer back to this section from formalization section and
    describe which of the properties we model and which we don't (and why?).
    Also refer back to here from the discussion session.
}
%
These are our interpretations of the claimed security properties described in
the \mSpec~\cite{selander-lake-edhoc-01}, Section 8.1:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Perfect Forward Secrecy (\textbf{PFS}) for the session key material
    \item Mutual authentication (this presumably refers to entity authentication
        because it is followed by claims of
        \textbf{consistency} (defined in~\cite{sigma}),
        \textbf{aliveness}, and
        \textbf{peer awareness} to the responder, but not to the initiator)
    \item \textbf{Identity protection} (the initiator against active attacks
        and the responder against passive attacks, except for \mPskPsk{})
    \item Key Compromise Impersonation (\textbf{KCI}) resistance
    \item A single session of \mEdhoc{} enables the responder to verify
            that the selected cipher suite is the most preferred of the
            initiator which is supported by both parties, even though there is
            no negotiation of cipher suites per se.
    \item \textbf{Session key independence}
\end{itemize}
