\begin{abstract}
\hl{250 words}
IETF is standardizing a key establishment protocol named \mEdhoc, for
constrained IoT devices.
%
In contrast to more powerful IoT devices, such as video cameras and cars,
which receive most attention from media, constrained devices often have severe
restrictions on energy consumption.
%
Additionally, they often use specialized wireless communication links with tough
constraints on message sizes, which may vary from message to message.
%
\mEdhoc{} was first formally analyzed by
Bruni~et.~al.~\cite{DBLP:conf/secsr/BruniJPS18}.
%
Since then, IETF has significantly extended the protocol, which is now a
framework with a number of cryptographic cores, called methods, where the
initial version of \mEdhoc{} contained only two out of five possibilities.
%
In this paper we formally analyze all methods of \mEdhoc{} in a symbolic model,
using the \mTamarin{} verification tool.
%
We show that the different methods provide sensible, but also rather
heterogeneous security properties, and discuss consequences of this.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Section: Situation and setting (\hl{Karl})}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item OK: Elaborate on the story line above
            \item OK: Explain the exploratory and iterative nature of industrial
                  standards and why this has resulted in the new \mStat methods.
            \item OK: Contrast with \mTls. Motivate why \mEdhoc{} is needed in
                addition to \mTls. Little analysis of \mEdhoc{} so far.
                Motivate that most security analysis and media attention is on
                larger IoT devices. Give examples and cite use cases whit
                constrained devices. Paint the (true) picture that this will
                become a serious security risk in the future if not a secure
                \mEdhoc{} is created.
            \item OK: Subsection: Contributions: model, verified properties,
                guidance on how various methods can be used (for std and
                implementations)
            \item OK: Subsection: Related work: \mOptls, \mNoise,
                Bruni~\cite{DBLP:conf/secsr/BruniJPS18}, Cremers' et. al. \mTls
                analysis with \mTamarin.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Section: \mEdhoc{} description (\hl{Vaishnavi})}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Describe evolved protocol from last \mEdhoc{} verification,
            \item Describe the overarching goal of \mEdhoc{} of security context
                establishment for \mEdhoc.
            \item Describe that \mEdhoc{} is a framework based on three different
                crypto-cores (\mPsk-based DH, \mSigma and \mOptls/\mNoise).
                Some inital thoughts on \mNoise here~\ref{sec:mail-notes-noise}.
                Describe how one party may use a \mSigma-like authentication
                whereas the other party may use \mOptls. The session key is
                the combination of the corresponding key material.
                Describe that this essentially makes
                \mEdhoc{} a framework where it is possible to run one out of 5
                different protocols.
            \item Describe \mSigSig method and relate it to original \mEdhoc{} and
                \mSigma. This can be brief. Identify and focus on potential
                differences.
            \item Describe \mPskPsk method.
            \item Main focus of this section. Describe \mStat based methods, which
                  have very different properties compared to original \mEdhoc,
                  which only had the single \mSigma method.
                  Draw a figure (use tikz for easiest handling), showing how the
                  protocols look like (\mStatStat, \mStatSig, \mSigStat are
                  sufficient, the \mPsk and \mSigSig methods are simpler/old and
                  less interesting).
                  Explain the difference in signatures: "Normal" vs. challenge
                  response signatures of \mStat-based method.
                  Explain how \mStatStat is basically running two interleaved
                  \mOptls protocols runs. Compare how \mStat based methods relate
                  to \mOptls and to relevant instance from \mNoise framework.
                  Make mapping as precise as possible, down to key derivation
                  inputs. If the mapping of protocol elements and inputs to
                  key derivations and other processing is sufficiently close,
                  then point to security proof for Noise and cite it. Otherwise
                  point out the differences.
             \item Describe additional components of \mEdhoc{} we've modeled,
                  e.g., \mCi and \mCr etc.
                  Explain relevance of \mCi and \mCr to \mOscore.
             \item Describe algorithm negotiation.
             \item Describe negotiation of method.
             \item Describe transmission of aux data and expected security
                 properties.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Section: \mEdhoc{} security model and formalization (\hl{Alessandro})}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Subsection: threat model. We assume secure binding between
                credentials and the identity. We assume adversary cannot
                register another key for a name for an uncorrupted party. We
                assume adversary has Dolev-Yao style access to communication
                between agents. We assume adversary can compromise session keys,
                but is then not allowed to "test" that session key (in
                computational terminology). We assume adversary can compromise
                parties, but is not allowed to "test" them or their partners if
                he has done so. Two peers are partnered if they agree on: Their
                identities, and the session key material (except \mGiy in the
                relevant cases of \mStat). That is the session identifier and it
                is unique per run, which the injective agreement lemmas show.
                Define what is the key material for each method
                (see the \mTamarin model).
            \item Subsection: Short description of \mTamarin. It is known by
                now, but a short overview does not hurt.
            \item Subsection: Explain details of model, which properties we have
                modeled, how, which trade-offs were made and why.
                Explain how we modeled inj-agree (a sentence or two). Explain
                why it fails when $I$ uses \mStat-method and the implicit auth
                lemma we showed instead
                (cite~\cite{DBLP:journals/iacr/GuilhemFW19} here where I got the
                basic idea. It is then extended with the reveal queries in our
                model; obviously: if you know about other sources for this
                please cite them too). Include code/lemmas as you see fit.
            \item Subsection: Clear bullet-list of what we have shown, including
                some statics of running time code size perhaps.
                Scan draft-selander and check what props are claimed there; see
                what we have covered and what we haven't.
                Already shown:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Mutual injective agreement on session key, method and identities for
                        $R \rightarrow I$ and $I \rightarrow R$ for all methods
                        except when $I$ uses STAT. When $I$ uses STAT, $R \rightarrow I$ holds,
                        but not $I \rightarrow R$.
                    \item Injective implicit agreement on session key.
                        Only really needed for $I \rightarrow R$, because in all other cases we have
                        the stronger injective agreement property. But show it now for all
                        methods to having a common (and reasonable) level of security that
                        holds no matter which method user chooses.
                    \item PFS on session key for all methods.
                    \item Key secrecy (follows from PFS).
                    \item Session key independence (follows from how we modeled PFS).
                    \item Entity authentication - we show this in the same lemmas as we show
                          inj-agree on session key.  We don't have this property when $I$ uses
                          STAT method because $I$ then gets no confirmation of
                          Pre-specified peer model.
                    \item Key confirmation (except for when $I$ uses \mStat
                        method, then $I$ gets no key confirmation on \mGiy)
                \end{itemize}
            \item See~\ref{sec:mail-notes-encr} for how encryption is modeled.
            \item Caveat: we have not modeled running all methods in parallel,
                so we don't know if an adversary can somehow trick $I$ into
                running one method and $R$ another, and by that causing some
                attack.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Section: Discussion (\hl{Karl})}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item{\textbf{Design practices}}
                \begin{itemize}
                \item OK. Discuss that the security properties varies between methods
                and that this may confuse implementers and user of libraries.
                \item OK. Discuss practice of listing claimed properties (likely copied
                from some academic paper) without justification in IETF drafts.
                \end{itemize}
            \item{\textbf{\mGiy and technical protocol issues}}
                \begin{itemize}
                \item Discuss unclearity regarding security model (trusted execution
                environment or not?). \mOptls has clear separation and therefore
                use both $g^{xy}$ and $g^{iy}$ etc. \mEdhoc{} is not as cleanly
                designed and according to IETF guys they don't care about
                trusted execution environments (see mail in txt-file).
                Would \mEdhoc{} be OK with skipping $g^{iy}$ from the session key
                material and only use $g^{xy}$ in that model? Probably yes, and
                then we can get inj-agree on the session key material, but then
                extending \mEdhoc{} implementations with a trusted execution
                environment for LTK operations is useless.
                \item OK: Discuss algorithm negotiation.
                \item OK: Discuss what should be used as session key and what the
                consequences of the choices are,
                see~\ref{sec:mail-notes-secrecy-sessions} and
                \ref{sec:mail-notes-session-key-mtrl}.
                \item OK: Discuss session key authentication and the problem of \mGiy,
                see~\ref{sec:mail-notes-session-key-auth}
                and~\ref{sec:mail-notes-session-key-imp-auth}
                \item OK: Discuss non-repudiation that was not included until we pointed
                it out.
                \item OK: Discuss the overlayed \mOptls construction and how an
                additional \mOscore message $R \rightarrow I$ would give key
                confirmation and hence explicit inj-agree also for $I$.
                \item Discuss Transcipt hashes that lag behind one message and that
                it is supposed to "cover as much as possible", but sometimes
                does not (check tamarin model also for inconsistencies between
                methods). Unclear design except "as much as possible".
                \end{itemize}

                \begin{itemize}
                \item OK: Discuss Identities and use-cases with the neighbours printer

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------- sub
\subsection{Background and motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}
IoT security threats involving cars, web-cameras and other resourceful devices
receive most attention from media and academia.
%
These devices are computationally strong with no severe bandwidth or energy
consumption restrictions.
%
Securing the communication between such devices can readily be done using
\mDandTls.
%
Constrained devices, on the other hand, where such restrictions on bandwidth or
energy are common, have received much less attention.
%
These devices may be simple sensors with the only task of relaying
measurements of their physical environment to a server every hour, but doing so
autonomously for a decade without maintenance.
%
To keep energy consumption down, highly specialized radio links with small
and heterogeneous frame sizes are sometimes used.
%
In some cases, \mDandTls{} messages are too large to fit into the radio frames.
%
This is one of the reasons IETF standardized the \mOscore{} protocol to secure
communications between constrained devices, as a complement for when
\mDandTls{} is too heavy weight~\cite{rfc8613}.
%

The \mOscore{} protocol requires a pre-established security context.
%
The IETF Lightweight Authenticated Key Exchange (LAKE) working group
is currently developing requirements and a key exchange protocol,
named \mEdhoc~\cite{selander-lake-edhoc-01}, capable of
establishing \mOscore{} security contexts.
%
Naturally, \mEdhoc{} must work under the same constrained requirements as
\mOscore{} itself.

\vnote{Should we say something about since when the LAKE WG has been working on this?}
\knote{We do write that the initial draft was in March 2016. IETF has been
    working on the protocol since then. Before that there was also work that
    lead up to recognizing the need for it. The forming of the LAKE WG came
    later. So it is difficult to say exactly how long IETF has been working on
    the problem. Also, giving the starting date of LAKE WG seems to be a bit
    misleading. If you have any good proposals for formulation, please propose
    one. Otherwise I'm OK with just giving March 2016 as first EDHOC draft.
}
\vnote{Maybe just say that? ``While there has been some work in the IETF on this problem, the first draft of EDHOC was proposed in March 2016...''?}
\knote{We already do say that (see three paragraphs down). I think it fits with
    the flow to keep it there, but feel free to propose an edit if you want to
    mention it earlier.
}
\vnote{I meant in the sense of pointing out that the WG is not just \emph{currently} working on this stuff, but has been for a while now. The fact that that point is three paragraphs down is what is problematic. I'll see if I can restructure it to say something better, otherwise we can stick with the current organization.}
%

While neither the requirements nor the use cases for \mEdhoc{} are firmly set,
the goal of \mEdhoc{} is to establish an \mOscore{} security
context, keeping messages small being the most prominent driver for the
design.
%
The LAKE working group is currently discussing whether a compressed version of
\mTls, named \mCtls~\cite{ietf-tls-ctls-00}, would suffice for the same use
cases as the combination of \mOscore{} and \mEdhoc, and try to identify which
those use cases are.
%

The \mEdhoc{} protocol has evolved significantly over time to cater for smaller
messages and more use cases.
%
The first incarnation of \mEdhoc{} appeared in March 2016.
%
It contained two different cryptographic cores, one based on a
pre-shared key Diffie-Hellman and a second following a draft of the
then emerging \mTls\ v1.3 standard~\cite{ietf-tls-tls13-11}, using
challenge-response signatures.
%
The latter was then replaced by \mSigma, and this version, from May 2018, was
formally analyzed by Bruni~et.~al.~\cite{DBLP:conf/secsr/BruniJPS18}.
%
The protocol has now further evolved and variants using challenge-response
signatures have now been added again by integrating the \mOptls{} core.
%
On top of this, mixed variants where one party uses a challenge-response
signature and the other a regular signature have also been added.
%
Consequently, there are now five cryptographic cores in total, and it is prudent
to formally analyze them all to ensure a higher level of security assurance for
\mEdhoc.
%
This is especially important, since the \mSpec{} itself lacks a description
of the intended security model and overall security goals.
%
Discussing how this gap can be filled, and how to identify what the expected
security goals should be, is an important part of this paper.

\subsection{Contributions}
\label{sec:contributions}
We have reviewed and analyzed the \mEdhoc{} protocol, which has continuously
evolved, at times based on our feedback.
%
The analysis spanned over roughly five months, but the formal models and proven
properties are based on to the version specified in the draft as it was
2020-03-01~\cite{selander-lake-edhoc-01}.
%

Our main contributions are the following.
\begin{itemize}
    \item We provide formalization of all five cryptographic cores of \mEdhoc{}
        using \mTamarin~\cite{DBLP:conf/cav/MeierSCB13}.
    \item We give an explicit security model for the protocol and have verified
        essential security properties, such as session key and entity
        authentication, as well as Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), within that
        model.
        From these explicitly proven properties other properties follow, e.g.,
        session key independence.
    \item We discuss the relation between proven properties, potentially missing
        properties and the lack of clear design goals and security model for
        \mEdhoc{}.
        Based on this we give recommendations for the future standards
        development in regards to clarity, not only in terms of under which
        technical restrictions the protocol must work, but also what its
        envisioned uses are.
    \item Our discussions with members of the IETF LAKE working group have already
        lead to improvements and clarifications of the standard \mSpec{} based
        on observations we made during the construction of our formal model.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Related work}
\label{sec:relatedWork}
The work closest to ours is Bruni~et. al.~\cite{DBLP:conf/secsr/BruniJPS18},
which used \mProverif~\cite{DBLP:conf/csfw/Blanchet01} to analyze an earlier,
two-cryptographic core, version of \mEdhoc.
%
We consider our work to be a sort of follow-up to that, doing a similar kind of
analysis of the most recent, and more elaborate, version of \mEdhoc{} with its
five cores.
%
We do, however, take a clean slate approach and look at the protocol as new.
%
For example, since the model has undergone so much change, the set of properties
which we verify is also different.
%
The \mTamarin{} tool has been used to verify many other protocols, perhaps
closest to our work is Cremers~et.~al's analysis of
\mTls~\cite{DBLP:conf/ccs/CremersHHSM17}.
%
Some of the cryptographic cores themselves have been analyzed in the
computational model, e.g., \mSigma{} by Canetti and
Krawczyk~\cite{DBLP:conf/crypto/CanettiK02}, \mOptls{} by Krawczyk and
Wee~\cite{DBLP:conf/eurosp/KrawczykW16}, and \mNoise{} by
Kobeissi~et.~al.~\cite{DBLP:conf/eurosp/KobeissiNB19}.
%
Computational models often rely on implicit session key authentication
(see for example the definition of SK-security in the Canetti-Krawczyk
model~\cite{DBLP:conf/crypto/CanettiK02}).
%
Although symbolic models predominantly rely on correspondence properties in the
style of Lowe~\cite{DBLP:conf/csfw/Lowe97a}, there are examples where implicit
authentication has been used.
%
For example, Schmidt~et.~al.~\cite{DBLP:conf/csfw/SchmidtMCB12} use a
symbolized version of an extended Canetti-Krawzcyk model.

\subsection{Unclear protocol use}
\label{sec:unclearProtocolUse}
In this section we discuss the fact that the design of \mEdhoc{} seems to be
mainly driven by what can be done given certain technical limitations.
%
There is a lack of goal-oriented design considerations, which we believe risk
creating a protocol that does not meet the needs of applications.
%
We also believe that this is related to the lack of a clear security model.
%

The basic premises for \mEdhoc{} are simple: establish an \mOscore{} security
context with few roundtrips and small messages.
%
However, these premises are only sufficient for an explorative research effort
to determine what kind of security properties can be achieved under these
restrictions.
%
Developing standards additionally requires an understanding of which security
properties would be suitable for products and applications implementing the
standard in the real world.
%
Suitability can only be evaluated against intended use of the protocol and an
intended security model.
%
The requirements document~\cite{ietf-lake-reqs-04} and the
\mSpec{}~\cite{selander-lake-edhoc-01} itself list a
number of detailed desirable security properties with little motivation for why
these are suitable ones, and without an outline of a security model where these
should hold.
%
While technical limitations, such as link restrictions and
the availability of only a certain type of credential for devices,
are mentioned, and design choices are motivated by these, there are no
application use cases or user stories capturing intended uses of \mEdhoc{}.
%
Consequently, while it is possible to verify that given these restrictions and
using the constructions in the \mSpec{}, \mEdhoc{} has certain security
properties, it is hard to say whether these are the necessary or even the
most useful ones for IoT use cases.
%
Having a better understanding of the security properties required by these use
cases would clearly help in guiding the design of \mEdhoc{}.
%
It may also help reducing the number of methods to the ones that are needed.
%
Further, better understanding the intended use of \mEdhoc{} helps
defining a clearer security model.
%
The current security model is vague and largely implicitly defined by attacks
that the protocol should withstand.
%

Similar to \mDandTls{}, \mEdhoc{} is intended to solve a variety of use cases,
many not known today, and therefore, it is not possible to collect all types
of use cases that need to be considered.
%
However, this is not a valid argument against collecting typical use cases and
user stories to capture at least \emph{some} of the security properties a
solution must exhibit.
%
\textbf{We propose that} the application usage of \mEdhoc{} is better defined via
user stories or use cases.
%
In fact, while constructing our model, we came up with simple user stories to
identify security properties of interest.
%
Several of these revealed undefined aspects of \mEdhoc{} that were then included
in the \mSpec.
%
We now give a few examples to demonstrate where some of our use cases and user
stories uncovered blind spots in the \mSpec.
%

\paragraph{Credentials stored in a trusted execution environment (TEE)}
The question is whether there will be applications where device is
deployed in a hostile environment, and where it is reasonable to assume it can
be equipped with a TEE.
%
In our analysis we have chosen not to model TEEs, by making use of session
state reveal queries.
%
This is because we received indications from the \mSpec{} authors that it was not
necessary to consider reveal of the session state, in particular the ephemeral
secret keys, with the rationale that \mSigma{} cannot protect against such an
attack (presumably based on that the \mSigSig{} method is closely based on
\mSigmaI{} and that it would be preferable to obtain some kind of homogeneity
among the \mEdhoc{} methods when it comes to what security properties they
provide).
%
That argument is however only true if one restricts attention to session key
confidentiality of an ongoing session.
%
TEEs do provide value by for example allowing for weak PCS guarantees.
%
Further, for protocols in the style of \mOptls{}, on which the \mStat{}-based
methods are modeled, both a static long-term
key an ephemeral are typically mixed to obtain the session key material.
%
This design is intentional, especially in the \mOptls{} case, where the protocol
is designed to be provably secure in the Canetti-Krawzcyk model.
%

\paragraph{Non-repudiation}
An access control solution for a nuclear power-plant may need to log who is
passing through a door, whereas it may be undesirable for privacy
purposes if it was even possible for a coffee vending machine to log such
information.
%
When we did that simple thought experiment we caught that the \mSpec{} did not
consider non-repudiation.
%
The authors of the \mSpec{} added a paragraph about which methods provided which
types of (non)-repudiation.
%
It would, however, be helpful for application developers to also document
example use cases showing the consequences of choosing the different methods,
perhaps in the security considerations section.
%
The \mPsk{} method or \mStat{}-based methods allow parties to obtain
non-repudiation, whereas using a \mSig{}-based method do not.
%

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------- sub
\subsection{Security claims}
\label{sec:securityClaims}
The \mSpec{} makes a number of detailed claims of properties
the protocol provides (see Section 8.1~\cite{selander-lake-edhoc-01}).
%
The intention may be that, if the academic protocol \mSigma{} is re-used as a
cryptographic core of \mEdhoc, then all the properties listed
in the paper analyzing \mSigma~\cite{DBLP:conf/crypto/CanettiK02} are the
necessary and sufficient ones and can be copied into the \mSpec.
%
(Note: presumably the intention is the same for the other reused cryprographic
cores based on \mOptls{} and \mNoise{}, but since the \mSpec{} is still work in
progress, it is not yet written down).
%
Section~8.1. states, \emph{"EDHOC inherits its security properties
from the theoretical SIGMA-I"}.
%
Designing a standard specification by re-using existing well-studied academic
components is good practice.
%
But when doing so, it is important to relate any changes made to the referred
cryptographic core or justification why the changes are appropriate.
%
Oterwise, one cannot draw the conclusions that a protocol inherits properties
from another.
%
The specification may not be the appropriate place for such analysis, but strong
claims about security properties deserve justification.
%

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------- sub
\subsection{Unintended authentication confusion}
\label{sec:usableSecurity}
Section 3.2 of the \mSpec, states that a policy is required restricting the set
of peers an entity is allowed to run \mEdhoc{} with.
%
However, because the initator is not required to verify that the \mIdcredr{}
received in message 2 is the same as the one it intended when sending message 1,
this is insufficient for a general purpose AKE.
%
This small thought example shows why.
%
Assume someone has configured all devices in their home to be in the restricted
set, but that one of the devices $A$ has been compromised.
%
If another device $B$, unaware of the compromise, initiates a connection to a
third device $C$, the compromised device $A$ may interfere.
%
$A$ may respond in $C$'s place, blocking the legitimate response from $C$.
%
Since $B$ does not check that it is $C$'s identity in message 2, and device $A$
is part of the restricted set, $B$ will complete and accept the \mEdhoc{} run
with device $A$ in stead of the intended $C$.

%
The obvious solution is for the initiator to match \mIdcredr{} to the intended
identity.
%
Note that it is insufficient to let \mEdhoc{} report to the application which
identity it established a security context with, because, even though the
application could reject the connection when there is a mismatch, the
application must be able to instruct \mEdhoc{} to not accept the same identity
next attempt, or there would be an infinite loop.
%

This is yet another example of where a small use case or user story uncovers
potential lacks in the \mSpec, and shows that it would be a useful addition to
the requirements document~\cite{ietf-lake-reqs-04}.
%
\vnote{I feel like sections 4.1 and 4.2 together serve to give a rather long-winded rationale for the fact that there the specification a) ill-specifies some security properties, and b) does not root its desirable properties in any use-cases, especially considering that the various methods fulfil different properties. It might be worthwhile to consider editing this part to merge all these sections, with short descriptions of these possible pitfalls discussed here to make the same point without so much belabouring.}
%
\knote{Better now?}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------- sub
\subsection{Session key material}
\label{sec:sessionKeyMaterial}
\mEdhoc{} establishes a session key state as output, from which session keys for
\mOscore{} can be derived using \mHkdf{}.
%
As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:threat-model}, there are various
possibilities for defining which parameters from the \mEdhoc{} run should
provide the secret input to the session key state.

While we show bidirectional injective agreement on \mGx{} and \mGy{}
for all methods, initiators cannot obtain injective agreement on \mGiy{} when
using the \mStat{} method themselves.
%
Therefore, \mGiy{} cannot be considered part of the key material if mutual
injective agreement is considered an important property for \mEdhoc{}.
%
Excluding \mGiy{} would deviate from \mOptls{}, which is the cryptographic core
used for these methods.
%
Specifically, the proof of session key confidentiality in the face of long-term
key compromise for \mOptls{} cannot be adapted for \mEdhoc{} because the
underlying assumption that \mGiy{} is part of the key material would no longer
be true.
%
Other security properties of \mOptls{} may also fail to be true if
\mGiy{} were excluded.
%

Another option is to include a fourth message from responder to initiator
carrying a message authentication code using a key derived from session key
material including \mGiy{}.
%
This would give the initiator sufficient guarantee that the responder indeed
uses the same \mGiy{} as the initiator.
%
The cost is an additional message, and our understanding is that this is
unacceptable. \vnote{Again, personal correspondence?}
%

In some use-cases there will be a such as message as part of
the subsequent \mOscore{} protocol run.
%
It would, however, create an additional dependence between the two protocols,
increasing complexity and the risk for insecure implementations.
%

Yet another option is to include \mGi{}, a hash of it, or a hash of \mIdcredi{}
if there is a one-to-one mapping between \mIdcredi{} and \mGi{}, in messages one
and two.
%
This would however increase message sizes, a grave concern for \mEdhoc{}, and
would prevent initiator identity protection.
%
While identity protection is important in general, the \mSpec{} nor the
requirements document give any rationale why the initiator's identity would be
more important to protect compared to the responder's.
%
The \mSpec{} states that the
initiator's identity is protected against active attacks and the responder's
against passive attacks, but that the roles should be assigned to the \mCoap{}
peers to protect the most sensitive identity the most (see
Section~8~\cite{selander-lake-edhoc-01}).
%
Roles could hence be swapped, so identity protection is not a strong argument
against this option.
%

We have show implicit agreement on \mGx{}, \mGy{} for all methods, and also on
\mGiy{} and \mGrx{} when these are used, see Section~\ref{sec:formalization}.
%
If this weaker security guarantee is sufficient, both ephemeral and long-term
keys can be part of the session key material.
%
Whether it is sufficient or not, depends on the intended uses of \mEdhoc{}.
%

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------- sub
\subsection{Cipher suite negotiation}
\label{sec:ciphersuiteNegotiation}
%
\mEdhoc{}'s cipher suite negotiation spans two or more executions of the protocol.
%
That is, an initiator keeps state between protocol runs and proposes an updated
set of cipher suites if the first run resulted in a rejection of the
cipher suite from the responder (see Section~\ref{sec:edhoc}.
%
Our model does not cover this.
%
\knote{It would be nice to be able to say something more than that "it is
    obivious" that at least the reject is authentic because we have agreement
on the keys for message 2 and it would be covered by the MAC. Ideas?}
\vnote{I don't quite know what you mean here. In fact, I do not cover the cipher suite negotiation at all in the protocol section. We should perhaps discuss this.}

We note that keeping state between protocol runs implicitly creates a long-lived
meta-session covering multiple \mEdhoc{} sessions.
%
While the spirit of the description in Section 4.2.2 of the \mSpec{} is that
within some kind of meta-session, presumably controlled by an application,
there is a re-negotiation due to
cipher suite mismatch between the initator and responder, the \mSpec{} does not
describe for how long the initator should remember a rejected cipher suite for a
given party.
%
From a security perspective, remembering the rejected cipher suite for the
next \mEdhoc{} run within a given application session would be sufficient.
%
It would also result in that, if the responder is updated with a new cipher
suite before the next application session, this would be taken into account.
%
On the other hand, caching the rejected cipher suite between application
sessions would reduce the number of round-trips for subsequent runs, should
the responder not have been updated.
%
Regardless, these considerations would be helpful to cover in the security
considerations section of the \mSpec{}.
