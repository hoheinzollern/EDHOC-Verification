    IETF is standardizing a key establishment protocol named \mEdhoc{} for
constrained IoT devices~\cite{selander-lake-edhoc-01}.
%
%In contrast to more powerful IoT devices, such as web cameras and cars, which receive most attention from media, constrained devices often have severe restrictions on energy consumption.
Compared to more powerful devices like web cameras and cars, which receive a lot of media attention, such devices operate under severe restrictions on energy consumption and message sizes.
%
%They also often use specialized wireless communication links with constraints on message sizes, which may also vary between messages.
%
A version of \mEdhoc{} was first formally analyzed in 2018 by Bruni~et~al~\cite{DBLP:conf/secsr/BruniJPS18}.
%
Since then, the protocol has been significantly extended and is now a
framework with five \vedit{cryptographic cores, called}{methods}, of which three are new.
%
%The initial version of \mEdhoc{} contained only two out of the current five methods~\cite{selander-ace-cose-ecdhe-08}.
%
In this paper we formally analyze all methods of \mEdhoc{} in a symbolic
Dolev-Yao model, using the \mTamarin{} verification tool. 
%
We show that the different methods provide sensible, but also rather
heterogeneous security properties, and discuss various consequences of this. Our work has also led to improvements in the design and the specification of \mEdhoc.

\subsection{Background and motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}
\fillhack
IoT security threats involving cars, web-cameras and similar devices
receive the most attention from media and academia.
%
These devices are computationally strong with no severe bandwidth or energy consumption restrictions.
%
Securing the communication between such devices can readily be done using existing protocols like \mDandTls.
%
Constrained devices, on the other hand, on which bandwidth and
energy consumption restrictions are common, have received much less attention.
%
These devices may be simple sensors with the only task of relaying
measurements of their physical environment to a server every hour, but doing so
autonomously for a decade without maintenance.
%
To keep energy consumption down, highly specialized radio links with small
and heterogeneous frame sizes are sometimes used.
%
IETF defined the Constrained Application Protocol (\mCoap{}) protocol for data
transport in such situations~\cite{rfc7252}.
%
\mCoap{} does not include security protection on its own, and in some cases, \mDandTls{} messages are too large to fit into the radio frames.
%
%This is one of the reasons 
Therefore, IETF standardized the Object Security for
Constrained RESTful Environments (\mOscore{}) protocol to secure
communications between constrained devices, as a complement for when
\mDandTls{} is too heavyweight~\cite{rfc8613}.
%

The \mOscore{} protocol requires a pre-established security context.
%
For a couple of years, the IETF Lightweight Authenticated Key Exchange (LAKE)
working group has been developing requirements and mechanisms for a key
exchange protocol, named \mEdhoc~\cite{selander-lake-edhoc-01}, capable of
establishing \mOscore{} security contexts.
%
Naturally, \mEdhoc{} must work under the same constrained requirements as
\mOscore{} itself.
%

While use cases for \mEdhoc{} are not firmly set, the overall goal of \mEdhoc{} is to establish an \mOscore{} security context, with message size limitations driving the design.
%
Discussions on the LAKE working group mailing list explored whether \mCtls~\cite{ietf-tls-ctls-00}, a compressed version of \mTls, would suffice for the same situations that the combination of \mOscore{} and \mEdhoc{} aim for.
%
The resulting consensus was to develop \mEdhoc{} in parallel with the development of \mCtls{} by the \mTls{} working groups.
%

The \mEdhoc{} protocol has evolved significantly over time to cater for smaller messages and more use cases.
%
The first incarnation of \mEdhoc{} appeared in March 2016.
%
It contained two different \vedit{cryptographic cores}{methods}, one based on a
pre-shared Diffie-Hellman (DH) key and a second based on a variant of
challenge-response signatures, in the style of the \mNoise{}
framework~\cite{perrin2016noise}.
%
The latter was then replaced by \mSigma{} in May 2018, and this version was formally analyzed by Bruni~et~al~\cite{DBLP:conf/secsr/BruniJPS18}.
%
Now, variants using challenge-response signatures have been added again by integrating the cryptographic core of \mOptls{}.
%
Additionally, mixed variants where one party uses a challenge-response
signature and the other a regular signature have also been added.
%
Consequently, there are now five \vedit{cryptographic cores}{methods} in total, and formal analysis is required to provide security guarantees for \mEdhoc.
%
This is especially important, since the \mSpec{} itself lacks a description
of the intended security model and overall security goals.
%
Discussing how this gap can be filled, and how to identify what the expected security goals should be, is an important part of this paper.
%

\subsection{Contributions}
\label{sec:contributions}
\fillhack
We formally analyze the \mEdhoc{} protocol, which has continuously evolved, at times based on our feedback.
%
%The analysis spanned roughly five months, but t
The formal models and proven properties are based on the version as on 2020-03-01~\cite{selander-lake-edhoc-01}.
%x
Our main contributions are as follows.
\begin{itemize}
    %\item We formally analyze all five methods of \mEdhoc{} using \mTamarin~\cite{DBLP:conf/cav/MeierSCB13}.
    \item We give an explicit security model for the protocol and verify
        essential security properties, such as session key and entity
        authentication, as well as Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), within that
        model, for all five methods of \mEdhoc.
        %From these explicitly proven properties other properties follow, e.g., session key independence. 
        The formal analysis is done using \mTamarin~\cite{DBLP:conf/cav/MeierSCB13}.
    \item We discuss the relation between proven properties, potentially missing
        properties and the lack of clear design goals and security model for
        \mEdhoc{}.
        Based on this we give recommendations for future standards
        development. %with regard to clarity, not only in terms of the         technical restrictions under which the protocol must work, but also what its         envisioned uses are.
    \item Our discussions with members of the IETF LAKE working group have already
        lead to improvements and clarifications of the standard \mSpec{} based
        on observations we made during the construction of our formal model. We discuss these in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.

\subsection{Related work}
\label{sec:relatedWork}
\fillhack
The work closest to ours is Bruni~et~al~\cite{DBLP:conf/secsr/BruniJPS18},
which used \mProverif~\cite{DBLP:conf/csfw/Blanchet01} to analyze an earlier version of \mEdhoc{} with two \vedit{cryptographic cores}{methods}. %~\cite{selander-ace-cose-ecdhe-08}.
%
We consider our work to be a sort of follow-up to that, doing a similar kind of analysis of the most recent version of \mEdhoc{} with
five \vedit{cores}{methods}.
%
%We do, however, look at the protocol afresh.
%
%For example, since the model has undergone so much change, the set of properties which we verify is also different.
%
%The \mTamarin{} tool has been used to verify many other protocols, perhaps closest to our work is Cremers~et.~al's analysis of \mTls~\cite{DBLP:conf/ccs/CremersHHSM17}.
%
Some of the cryptographic cores themselves have been analyzed in the
computational model, e.g., \mSigma{}~\cite{DBLP:conf/crypto/CanettiK02}, \mOptls{}~\cite{DBLP:conf/eurosp/KrawczykW16}, and \mNoise{}~\cite{DBLP:conf/eurosp/KobeissiNB19}.
%
Computational models often rely on implicit session key authentication
(see, for example, the definition of SK-security in the Canetti-Krawczyk model~\cite{DBLP:conf/crypto/CanettiK02}).
%
Although symbolic models predominantly rely on correspondence properties, there are examples where implicit authentication has been used.
%in the style of Lowe~\cite{DBLP:conf/csfw/Lowe97a}
%
For example, Schmidt~et~al~\cite{DBLP:conf/csfw/SchmidtMCB12} use a
symbolized version of an extended Canetti-Krawzcyk model.

}
There are a few instances where things are ill-specified in the \mSpec{},
which we found as part of this work. We discuss them below.
%
\spacehack

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------- sub
\subsection{Security claim justification}
\label{sec:securityClaims}
\fillhack
The \mSpec{} makes detailed claims about security properties that \mEdhoc{}
enjoys, which the authors assume hold because they reuse cryptographic cores
from existing academic protocols.
%
Specifically, in Section~8.1 of~\cite{selander-lake-edhoc-01}, the authors
claim that ``EDHOC inherits its security properties from the theoretical
SIGMA-I''.
%
The intention is the same for the other reused cryptographic
cores based on \mOptls{} and \mNoise{}, but since the \mSpec{} is still work in
progress, it is not yet written down (personal correspondence with the authors).
%

While it is good practice to reuse well-studied academic components in
industrial standards, it is important to justify that changes made to these
components preserve security properties.
%
Some properties have been verified~\cite{DBLP:conf/secsr/BruniJPS18} and the
present paper verifies more, but until some justification is provided, security
claims may benefit from note of caution.
\spacehack
\knote{Specifically, our paper  sholdn't just point out that something is
wrong. We should constructively propose solutions to problems.}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------- sub
\subsection{Lack of clear use-cases}
\label{sec:unclearProtocolUse}
\fillhack
Formal verification aims to verify whether well-specified security goals hold
for particular security models, defined in terms of attacker capabilities,
assumptions on storage and processing by parties etc.
%
Without a clear picture of the intended uses of the protocol, it cannot be
determined which properties are the most important ones for constrained IoT
applications.
%

Much like \mDandTls{}, \mEdhoc{} is intended for a variety of use cases,
many of which are not even known today. However, one can still collect a
variety of \emph{typical} use cases and user stories.
%
Having a better understanding of the security properties required by these use
cases would help define a clearer security model, and thus guide the design of
\mEdhoc{}.
%
For example, one might be able to reduce the number of methods to only
a few needed ones.
%

While constructing our model, we came up with simple user stories to identify
security properties of interest.
%
Several of these revealed undefined aspects of \mEdhoc{} that were then
included in the \mSpec.
%
We present below a couple of examples.
%

\spacehack
\subsubsection{Credentials stored in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)}
It is conceivable that IoT devices deployed in a hostile environments can be
hardened by equipping them with a TEE, but \mEdhoc{} is not intentionally
designed to take advantage of this.
%
The reason is, as already mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:unclearProtocolUse},
that \mEdhoc{}
To see this, consider typical theoretical security frameworks, e.g.,
CK~\cite{DBLP:conf/crypto/CanettiK02}, which model TEEs in a device by allowing
an attacker access to ephemeral keys or session state while long-term keys
stored in the TEE remain secret (for example as we modeled it in
Section~\ref{sec:formalization}.
%
Even with these strengthened attacker capabilities, some or all of the intended
security properties shall still hold.
%
\mEdhoc{} is however not constructed with theoretical analysis framework in
mind.
ed indications from the \mSpec{} authors (personal correspondence) that it was
not necessary to consider revealing of the ephemeral secret keys, i.e., not
necessary to consider compromised TEEs. 
%

The rationale is that \mSigma{} cannot protect against such an attack
(presumably based on the fact that the \mSigSig{} method is closely based on
\mSigmaI{} and that it would be preferable to obtain some kind of homogeneity
among the \mEdhoc{} methods when it comes to what security properties
they provide).
\vnote{Speculation?}
\knote{No, it is based on the personal correspondance referred to in the
previous sentence.}
%
That argument is only true, however, if one restricts attention to session key
confidentiality of an ongoing session.
%
TEEs do provide value by, for example, allowing weak PCS guarantees.
%
Furthermore, in the \mStat{}-based methods, a static long-term key and an
ephemeral one are mixed to obtain the session key material.
%
This design is intentional, especially in the \mOptls{} case, where the
protocol is designed to be provably secure in the Canetti-Krawczyk model.
\vnote{So?}
\knote{You have now split the text over separate sections so the explanation is
    even less clear than originally. The point is that there is a difference
    between academic protocol design, which has clear definitions and goals to
    verify, and industrial protocol design which more follows the
    penetrate-and-patch approach (that is an exaggeration, but just to make
    the point).
}

\spacehack
\subsubsection{Non-repudiation}
An access control solution for a nuclear power-plant may need to log who is
passing through a door, whereas it may be undesirable for, say, a coffee
machine to log a list of users along with their coffee preferences.
%
Via this simple thought experiment, we realized that the \mSpec{} did not
consider non-repudiation.
%
In response, the authors of the \mSpec{} added a paragraph about which methods
provided which types of (non)-repudiation.

\spacehack
\subsubsection{Unintended peer authentication}
Section 3.2 of the \mSpec{} states that parties must be configured
with a policy restricting the set of peers they can run \mEdhoc{} with.
%
However, the initiator is not required to verify that the \mIdcredr{} received
in the second message is the same as the one intended at initialization.
%
The following thought experiment shows why such a policy is insufficient.
%

Assume that someone has configured all devices in their home to be in the
allowed set of devices, but that one of the devices ($A$) has since been
compromised.
%
If another device $B$, unaware of the compromise, initiates a connection to a
third device $C$, the compromised device $A$ may interfere.
%
$A$ may respond in $C$'s place, blocking the legitimate response from $C$.
%
Since $B$ does not verify $C$'s identity in the second message, and device $A$
is part of the allowed set, $B$ will complete and accept the \mEdhoc{} run
with device $A$ instead of the intended $C$.
%
The obvious solution is for the initiator to match \mIdcredr{} to the intended
identity provided by the application.

\vnote{Has this been pointed out to the authors of the \mSpec?}
\knote{Yes, everything has been pointed out to the authors of \mSpec{}.}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------- sub
\spacehack
\subsection{Session key material}
\label{sec:sessionKeyMaterial}
\fillhack
\mEdhoc{} establishes a session key state as output, from which session keys
for \mOscore{} can be derived using \mHkdf{}.
%
As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:threat-model}, there are various possibilities
for defining which parameters from the \mEdhoc{} run should be included in the
session key state.
%

While we show bidirectional injective agreement on \mGx{} and \mGy{}
for all methods, initiators cannot obtain injective agreement on \mGiy{} when
using the \mStat{} method themselves. Therefore, \mGiy{} cannot be considered
part of the key material if mutual injective agreement is considered important.
%
Excluding \mGiy{} would deviate from \mOptls{}, which is the cryptographic core
used for the \mStat-based methods. Specifically, the proof of session key
confidentiality in the face of long-term key compromise for \mOptls{} cannot be
adapted for \mEdhoc{}.
%
Other security properties of \mOptls{} may also fail to be true if
\mGiy{} were excluded. \vnote{Conjecture.}
\knote{Correct. The logic is the same as when we want to give at least one
    example to show that \mEdhoc{} is different from \mNoise{} and therefore the
proofs of \mNoise{} does not carry over to \mEdhoc{}. }
%

=>>> flow broken by copy/paste FIXME
This can be avoided by including a fourth message from responder to initiator
carrying a message authentication code using a key derived from session key
material including \mGiy{}.
%
This would give the initiator sufficient guarantees about the same \mGiy{}
being used by the responder as well.
%
However, the cost is an additional message, and our understanding is that this
is unacceptable (personal correspondence with the \mSpec{} authors).
%
In some use cases there could be a such as message as part of
the subsequent \mOscore{} protocol run. It would, however, create an additional
dependency between the two protocols, increasing complexity and the risk of
insecure implementations.
%

Yet another option is to include \mGi{}, or a hash of it, in the first and
second message.
%
This would, however, increase message sizes, a grave concern for \mEdhoc{},
and would also prevent initiator identity protection.
%
While identity protection is important in general, neither the \mSpec{} nor
the requirements document give any rationale why one identity (the intiator's)
is deemed more important (and needs protection) than the other
(the responder's).
%

The \mSpec{} states that the initiator's identity is protected against active
attacks and the responder's against passive attacks, but that the roles should
be assigned to the \mCoap{} peers to protect the most sensitive identity the
most (see Section~8~\cite{selander-lake-edhoc-01}).
%
Roles could hence be swapped, so identity protection is not a strong argument
against this option.
%
So perhaps this method can be used to obtain injective agreement on \mGiy.
%
\knote{If I did not uncomment the first two sentences in the paragraph above,
the last sentence made no sense on its own. I believe the idea is important,
because it gives a suggestion on how standardization may proceed if they
actually want inj-agree on \mGiy. We want to propose solutions, not just point
out problems.}
%

In this work, we have shown implicit agreement on \mGx{}, \mGy{} for all
methods, and also on \mGiy{} and \mGrx{} when these are used,
see Section~\ref{sec:formalization}.
%
If this weaker security guarantee is sufficient, both ephemeral and long-term
keys can be part of the session key material.
%
However, this also depends on the intended use of \mEdhoc{}.
%

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------- sub
\spacehack
\subsection{Cipher suite negotiation}
\label{sec:ciphersuiteNegotiation}
\fillhack
%
Cipher suite negotiation in \mEdhoc{} spans two or more executions of the
protocol.
%
If a run terminates due to the proposed cipher suites being rejected by the
responder, the initiator maintains state and initiates a new run, proposing
an updated set of cipher suites (see Section~\ref{sec:edhoc}).
%
Our model does not cover this, and we leave it for future work.

Maintaining state between protocol runs implicitly creates a long-lived
meta-session covering multiple \mEdhoc{} sessions.
%
Such a meta-session is presumably controlled by the underlying application.
%
However, the \mSpec{} does not specify the time for which the initiator should
remember a rejected cipher suite for a given responder.
%

From a security perspective, remembering the rejected cipher suite for the
next \mEdhoc{} run in the same meta-session would be sufficient.
%
If the responder is updated with a new cipher suite before the next such
session, this could be taken into account. On the other hand, caching the
rejected cipher suite between meta-sessions would reduce the number of
round-trips for subsequent runs, should the responder not have been updated.
%
This needs to be clearly specified.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
\fillhack
We have formally modeled all five
methods of the \mEdhoc{} key establishment protocol using the \mTamarin{} tool.
%
We formulated and verified several important security properties in this model. 
%
%We also identified security properties that do not hold for all methods.
%
Most importantly, we found that injective agreement on \mGiy{} does not hold for
initiators when they use the \mStat{} method.
%
Further, we identified a situation where initiators may establish an \mOscore{} security context with a different party than the application using \mEdhoc{} intended, and proposed a simple mitigation.
%
We discussed how the IETF may extract and better define security properties to enable easier verification.
