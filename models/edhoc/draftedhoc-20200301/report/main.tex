%\hl{250 words}
The IETF is standardizing an authenticated key establishment (AKE) protocol
named \mEdhoc{} for constrained IoT devices~\cite{selander-lake-edhoc-01}.
%
In contrast to more powerful devices like web cameras and cars, which receive a
lot of media attention, such devices operate under severe energy consumption
and message size restrictions.
%
\mEdhoc{} was first formally analyzed in 2018 by
Bruni~et~al.~\cite{DBLP:conf/secsr/BruniJPS18}.
%
Since then, the protocol has been significantly extended and now has three new
key establishment methods.
%
In this paper, we formally analyze all methods of \mEdhoc{} in a symbolic
Dolev-Yao model, using the \mTamarin{} verification tool.
%
We show that the different methods provide sensible, but also rather
heterogeneous security properties, and discuss various consequences of this.
%
Our work has also led to improvements in the design and the specification of
\mEdhoc.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------- sub
\subsection{Background and motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}
IoT security threats involving computationally strong devices such as cars
and web-cameras receive the most attention from media and academia.
%
Securing communication between such devices can readily be done using existing
protocols like \mDandTls.
%
Constrained devices and networks, on the other hand, which operate under severe
bandwidth and energy consumption restrictions, have received much less
attention.
%
These devices may be simple sensors which only relay environment
measurements to a server every hour, but need to function autonomously without
maintenance for long periods of time.
%
To keep energy consumption down, highly specialized radio links with small
and heterogeneous frame sizes are sometimes used.
%
The IETF defined the Constrained Application Protocol (\mCoap{}) protocol for
data transmission in such situations~\cite{rfc7252}.
%
\mCoap{} does not include security protection on its own, and in some cases,
\mDandTls{} messages are too large to fit into the radio frames, or is
unsuitable to handle proxy operations with change of underlying transport
protocol.
%
These are some of the reasons the IETF standardized the Object Security for
Constrained RESTful Environments
(\mOscore{}) protocol to secure communications between constrained
devices~\cite{rfc8613}.
%

The \mOscore{} protocol requires a pre-established security context.
%
For a couple of years, requirements and mechanisms for a key
exchange protocol, named \mEdhoc~\cite{selander-lake-edhoc-01}, for
establishing \mOscore{} security contexts have been discussed in the IETF.
%
Naturally, \mEdhoc{} must work under the same constrained requirements as
\mOscore{} itself.
%
While not all use cases for \mEdhoc{} are firmly set, the overall goal is to
establish an \mOscore{} security context, under message size limitations.
%
The work is now being done in the IETF Lightweight Authenticated Key Exchange
(LAKE) working group.
%

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------- sub
\subsection{Related Work}
\label{sec:relatedWork}
%
The first incarnation of \mEdhoc{} appeared in March 2016.
%
It contained two different key establishment methods, one based on a
pre-shared Diffie-Hellman (DH) cryptographic core and a second based on a
variant of challenge-response signatures, in the style of the \mNoise{}
framework~\cite{perrin2016noise}.
%
By a cryptographic core, or simply core, we mean an academic protocol, without
encodings or application specific details required by an industrial protocol.
%
By a key establishment method we mean a core with such details added.
%

The core based on challenge-response signatures was replaced by \mSigma{}
in May 2018.
%
Now, variants using challenge-response signatures have been added again by
integrating the cryptographic core of \mOptls{}.
%
Additionally, mixed variants where one party uses a challenge-response
signature and the other a regular signature have also been added.
%
Consequently, there are now five methods in total, and formal analysis is
required to verify security guarantees for \mEdhoc.
%
This is especially important, since the \mSpec{} itself lacks a description
of the intended security model and overall security goals.
%

Three cores have been analyzed in the computational model (\mSigma{}~\cite{DBLP:conf/crypto/CanettiK02},
\mOptls{}~\cite{DBLP:conf/eurosp/KrawczykW16}, and
\mNoise{}~\cite{DBLP:conf/eurosp/KobeissiNB19}).
%
However, there are significant departures from these cores in \mEdhoc, and
these proofs do not carry over automatically
(See Section~\ref{sec:relationsToOtherProtocols}).
%
The work closest to ours is Bruni~et~al.~\cite{DBLP:conf/secsr/BruniJPS18},
formally analyzing the May 2018 version of \mEdhoc{} (with two methods) in
\mProverif~\cite{DBLP:conf/csfw/Blanchet01}.
%

%\knote{should be moved to section 3}
%
%Computational models often rely on implicit session key authentication
%(see, for example, the definition of SK-security in the Canetti-Krawczyk
%model~\cite{DBLP:conf/crypto/CanettiK02}).
%%
%Although symbolic models predominantly rely on correspondence properties
%in the style of Lowe~\cite{DBLP:conf/csfw/Lowe97a}, there are examples where
%implicit session key authentication has been used.
%%
%For example, Schmidt~et~al.~\cite{DBLP:conf/csfw/SchmidtMCB12} use a
%symbolized version of an extended Canetti-Krawzcyk model.

\subsection{Contributions}
\label{sec:contributions}
We formally analyze the \mEdhoc{} protocol in the \mTamarin{}
tool~\cite{DBLP:conf/cav/MeierSCB13}.
%
This work is presented in Section~\ref{sec:formalization}.
%
The formal models and proven properties are based on the version as on
2020-03-01~\cite{selander-lake-edhoc-01}.
%
We give an explicit security model for the protocol and verify essential
properties, such as session key and entity authentication and perfect forward
secrecy, for all five methods.
%
We also discuss the relationship between proven properties and the claimed
security properties, and the lack of a precise security model for \mEdhoc{}.
%
In fact, the standard has already been improved based on our analysis,
which we discuss in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
There are a few instances where \mEdhoc{} can be improved,
which we found during this work and communicated to the authors. We discuss them below.
%

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------- sub
\subsection{Security Claim Justification}
\label{sec:securityClaims}
The \mSpec{} makes detailed claims about security properties that \mEdhoc{}
enjoys, which the authors assume hold because they reuse cryptographic cores
from existing academic protocols.
%
Specifically, in Section~8.1 of~\cite{selander-lake-edhoc-01}, the authors
claim that ``EDHOC inherits its security properties from the theoretical
\mbox{SIGMA-I}''.
%
The intention is the same for the other reused cryptographic
cores based on \mOptls{} and \mNoise{}, but since the \mSpec{} is still work in
progress, it is not yet written down~\cite{personalCommunication}.
%

While it is good practice to reuse well-studied academic components in
industrial standards, it is important to justify that changes made to these
components preserve security properties.
%
Some properties have been verified~\cite{DBLP:conf/secsr/BruniJPS18} and this paper verifies more, but until some justification is provided, security
claims may benefit from a note of caution.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------- sub
\subsection{Unclear Intended Use}
\label{sec:unclearProtocolUse}
Formal verification methodologies often clash with industrial standard
development practices; this is true also in our case.
%
The most important reason for the clash is that formal verification aims to
verify whether well-specified and detailed security goals are met, whereas
industrial standards are developed with a clear abstract goal,
but one that lacks specificity.
%
Instead the goals are there typically made more specific by listing resistance
to attacks as these are discovered throughout the work.
%
Granted, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:claimedProperties}, the \mSpec{} lists
several specific security goals.
%
However, without knowing how the protocol is to be used,
it is not clear whether these are the most important goals for constrained IoT
devices.
%

The abstract goal of \mEdhoc{} is simple: establish an \mOscore{} security
context using few roundtrips and small messages.
%
From that, the design of \mEdhoc{} is mainly driven by what
can be achieved given the technical restrictions.
%
Focusing too much on what can be achieved within given restrictions, and paying
too little attention to the use cases where the
protocol is to be used and their specific goals, risks resulting in
sub-optimal trade-offs and design decisions.
%

\mEdhoc{} is intended to cover a variety of use cases, many of which are
difficult to predict today.
%
Just because it is difficult to predict these use cases, does not
prevent one from collecting \emph{typical} use cases and user stories
to identify more specific security goals that will be important in most cases.
%

While constructing our model, we came up with simple user stories to identify
security properties of interest.
%
Several of these revealed undefined aspects of \mEdhoc{}.
%
We informed the \mEdhoc{} authors, who then included these aspects the \mSpec{}.
%
We present a couple of examples here.\\
%

%\subsubsection{Non-repudiation.}
\runhead{Non-repudiation}
An access control solution for a nuclear power-plant may need to log who is
passing through a door, whereas it may be undesirable for, say, a coffee
machine to log a list of users along with their coffee preferences.
%
Via this simple thought experiment, we realized that the \mSpec{} did not
consider non-repudiation.
%
In response, the authors of the \mSpec{} added a paragraph about which methods
provided which types of (non)-repudiation~\cite{selander-lake-edhoc-01}. \\

%\subsubsection{Unintended Peer Authentication.}
\runhead{Unintended Peer Authentication}
Section~3.2 of the \mSpec{} states that parties must be configured
with a policy restricting the set of peers they can run \mEdhoc{} with.
%
However, the initiator is not required to verify that the \mIdcredr{} received
in the second message is the same as the one intended at initialization.
%
The following thought experiment shows why such a policy is insufficient.
%

Assume that someone has configured all devices in their home to be in the
allowed set of devices, but that one of the devices ($A$) is compromised.
%
If another device $B$, initiates a connection to a third device $C$, the
compromised device $A$ may interfere by responding in $C$'s place, blocking
the legitimate response from $C$.
%
Since $B$ does not verify that the received identity in the second message
matches the intended identity $C$, and device $A$ is part of the allowed set,
$B$ will complete and accept the \mEdhoc{} run with device $A$ instead of the
intended $C$.
%
The obvious solution is for the initiator to match \mIdcredr{} to the intended
identity provided by the application.
%
We have communicated this situation to the \mEdhoc{} authors and they are considering
how to resolve the issue.
%

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- sub
\subsection{Unclear Security Model}
When designing a security protocol, the attacker's capabilities must be
considered so that it is possible to determine whether the protocol is
sufficiently secure.
%
That is, a security model in which the protocol is deemed
secure needs to be defined at least on a high level.
%
We argue that the \mSpec{} gives too little information about what capabilities
an attacker is assumed to have, and that this leads to unclear design goals and
potentially sub-optimal design.
%
%Let us explore this via an example.
%

It is conceivable that IoT devices deployed in a hostile environments can be
hardened by equipping them with a TEE, but \mEdhoc{} is not %intentionally
designed to take advantage of this.
%
Even though \mEdhoc{} incorporates cryptographic cores from different academic
security protocols, its design does not take into account the attacker models
for which these protocols were designed.
%
For example, \mOptls{} is designed to be secure in the CK
model~\cite{DBLP:conf/crypto/CanettiK02}.
%
The CK security model explicitly separates the secure storage of long-term
credentials from storage of session state and ephemeral keys to model the 
use of TEEs.
%

The \mEdhoc{} authors indicated to us that it was
not necessary to consider compromised ephemeral session keys separately from
from compromised long-term keys.
%
The rationale is that \mSigma{} cannot protect against compromised ephemeral
keys~\cite{personalCommunication}.
%
That rationale is presumably based on the fact that the \mSigSig{} method is
closely modeled on \mSigmaI{} and that it would be preferable to obtain a
homogeneous security level among the \mEdhoc{}
methods.
%
That rationale is only true, however, if one restricts attention to session key
confidentiality of an ongoing session.
%
TEEs provide value in other ways, for example, by allowing contractions with
weak PCS guarantees.
%
It would be wasteful to not consider TEEs for long-term key storage as part of
the security, since it could otherwise make use of many good properties of the
re-used cryptographic cores, like \mOptls.
%
%For example, coming back to \mOptls{}, which was intentionally
%designed to be provably secure in the CK model.
%\vnote{Incomplete sentence?}
%

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------- sub
\subsection{Session Key Material}
\label{sec:sessionKeyMaterial}
\mEdhoc{} establishes session key material, from which session keys
can be derived using the \mEdhoc{}-Exporter.
%
The session key material is affected by \mGxy{}, and if a party uses the
\mStat{} method, also by that party's secret static long-term DH key.
%
As shown in Section~\ref{sec:formalization}, mutual injective agreement cannot
be achieved for \mGiy{}.
%
If this property is not important for constrained IoT devices which cannot use
any of the other methods, then one can simply accept that the methods have
different authentication strengths.
%
However, if it is important, this is a problem.
%

We identified three alternatives for resolving this.
%
One is to include a fourth message from responder to initiator,
carrying a MAC based on a key derived from session key
material including \mGiy{}.
%
Successful MAC verification guarantees
to the initiator that the responder injectively agrees on \mGiy{}.
%
However, our understanding is that adding an extra message is
undesirable, since~\cite{selander-lake-edhoc-01} requests as few messages as
possible.
%

Another possibility is to include \mGi{}, or its hash, in the first and
second messages.
%
This would, however, increase message sizes, a grave concern for \mEdhoc{}.
%and prevent initiator identity protection.
%

A third alternative is to not derive the session key material from \mGiy{}.
%
Doing so would destroy the protection \mOptls{} provides against compromise
of the initiator's ephemeral DH key.
%

Regardless of how this problem is handled, we have verified that all methods
share a common, but weaker, security property: mutual implicit authentication
on all of \mGxy{}, \mGiy{} and \mGrx{}.
%

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------- sub
\subsection{Cipher Suite Negotiation}
\label{sec:ciphersuiteNegotiation}
%\knote{If we are tight on space, we can consider removing this section since we
%    don't verify any negotiation. We did have impact on the \mEdhoc{} \mSpec
%    with this though.
%}
%

Cipher suite negotiation in \mEdhoc{} spans one or more executions of the
protocol.
%
As part of the first message, the initiator proposes an ordered list of cipher suites they support (see Section~\ref{sec:edhoc}, Figure~\ref{fig:edhocFramework}). The responder either accepts the highest entry in this list (if they also support that suite) or makes a counter-proposal, namely the highest entry which they do support. If there is no such entry the responder rejects the suite entirely, and the protocol does not continue. 
%
If a run terminates due to the proposed cipher suites being rejected by the
responder, the initiator maintains state and initiates a new run, proposing
an updated set of cipher suites.
%
%Our model does not cover this, and we leave it for future work.
%Maintaining state between protocol runs 
This implicitly creates a long-lived
meta-session covering multiple \mEdhoc{} sessions.
%
%Such a meta-session is presumably controlled by the underlying application.
%

However, the time for which the initiator should
remember a rejected cipher suite for a given responder is not specified.
%
From a security perspective, remembering the rejected cipher suite for the
next \mEdhoc{} run in the same meta-session would be sufficient.
%
If the responder is updated with a new cipher suite before the next such
session, this could be taken into account. On the other hand, caching the
rejected cipher suite between meta-sessions would reduce the number of
round-trips for subsequent runs, should the responder not have been updated.
%
This needs to be clearly specified, and we have conveyed this to the authors of the \mSpec.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------- sec
\section{Conclusions and future work}
\label{sec:conclusions}
We formally modeled all five
methods of the \mEdhoc{} key establishment protocol using the \mTamarin{} tool, and
formulated and verified several important security properties in this model --
PFS; session key material independence; mutual injective agreement on roles, identities and session key material
(except for when the initiator uses the \mStat{} method); implicit
authentication on on the same parameters for all methods; consitency, aliveness
and peer awareness (the last two when mutual injective agreement holds);
entity authentication (also when mutual injective agreement holds).
%
%We also identified security properties that do not hold for all methods.
%
Most importantly, we found that injective agreement on \mGiy{} does not hold for
initiators when they use the \mStat{} method.
%
We verified each method in isolation, and leave as future work to verify whether
the methods are secure under composition.
%

Further, we identified a situation where initiators may establish an \mOscore{}
security context with a different party than the application using \mEdhoc{}
intended, and proposed a simple mitigation.
%
We discussed how the IETF may extract and better define security properties to
enable easier verification.
%
There is some work that was done as part of this effort which has not been mentioned in this paper. These lines of enquiry form the basis for future work.
%For more details, see~\cite{edhocTamarinRepo}.

We considered two more properties, namely key-compromise impersonation (KCI) resistance and weak post-compromise security (PCS). A protocol is said to have KCI resistance if a party $I$ can establish a secure session with party $R$, even if $I$'s keys are compromised at any time, and $R$'s key material is not leaked until the end of the session. The authors of \mSpec{} claim that \mEdhoc{} has KCI resistance. Weak PCS~\cite{cohn2016post} is said to hold if a session key established in a run $\rho$ between parties $I$ and $R$ continues to be secret between them, even if $\rho$ was such that the attacker could perform cryptographic operations using $I$ and $R$'s long term keys (without having access to the keys themselves). We verified that KCI resistance and weak PCS guarantees hold for the \mSigSig{} and \mPskPsk{} methods.
However, the tool does not terminate for these properties on the other methods, and therefore, we do not know whether the \mStat-based methods enjoy these properties or not. We relegate the verification of these properties for the \mStat-based methods to future work. 

We also tried to incorporate the parameters \mCi, \mCr, and \mAD{} into our model. This too resulted in non-termination for some of the methods, and further study is required to obtain conclusive results along these lines. 

Another potential extension is to incorporate the cipher suite negotiation process into the formal modeling.\\
